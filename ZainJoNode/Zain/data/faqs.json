Because the product pays principal over its lifetime, its face value is likely to deteriorate over time, and therefore, typically, the Factor is less than one. For example, to determine the Most Recent Value of a fixed income product with a Factor, Price is multiplied by Quantity and Factor, and that number is divided by 100.For factored securities, as well as all fixed income securities, both the Most Recent Value and Previous Value use the price determined as of the previous day's close of business valuation. If a portion or all of the position is sold during the day, the Price and Factor of the security will continue to be based on the previous day's close of business valuation (although the Value fields will reflect the intraday change in Quantity).",
  "How soon after I make a trade will it appear on Open Positions?": "Positions for stocks, ETFs, options, and fixed income products are updated immediately after the trade is executed (upon positions screen load or refresh). The only exception is for mutual funds, which are updated the next day after the overnight cycle.Securities not priced today will include a purple indicator in the top right corner of their Today's Gain/Loss column. Some securities, such as mutual funds, are not priced until after the market closes.For details on the change in securities priced today and securities not priced today, select the Today's Gain/Loss subtotal, which is marked with a dotted underline. This will display a detailed breakdown of the values.",
  "How are distributions calculated and posted to an account?": "Mutual funds that accrue income daily, such as many bond and money market funds, pay a monthly dividend equal to the sum of each day's share balance multiplied by the fund's daily mill rate. Therefore, the distribution amount you receive may not equal the monthly mill rate sum multiplied by your month-end balance. Changes in your fund's share balance throughout the month will affect the distribution you receive at the end of the month.Mutual funds that do not accrue income daily, such as many equity funds, may declare a distribution on a specified date (often monthly or quarterly). The amount of distribution you receive in this instance is equal to the number of shares you hold on the record date multiplied by the per share distribution amount.",
  "How often are prices updated on Open Positions?": "Prices are updated, or refreshed, whenever the page is loaded or reloaded in your browser.

You can also filter information by security type using the Show dropdown menu. Note: Filtering choices will reset to the default view each time you return to the Open Positions page.",
  "What transactions can affect my cost basis?": "Any transaction that increases or decreases the number of shares in a position can affect cost basis, including buying or selling shares, splits, spin-offs, and liquidations. Depending on the type of security, other factors beyond the original purchase price can also impact cost basis. Consider the following:Dividends and capital gainsEach time you reinvest dividends or capital gains, you are purchasing additional shares. These purchases may change the cost basis of your overall position, but they will not impact the cost basis of shares that you already own. The cost basis for any new shares is calculated the same way you would calculate cost basis for any other type of purchase.Purchase commissions, purchase charges, and purchase feesIf you buy shares of a mutual fund that has a load (sales charge) or transaction fee, you should include the charge or fee paid as part of the cost basis. Similarly, commissions, fees, and taxes paid when you buy an individual security should be added to cost basis. Including these charges can reduce your future capital gains because they increase your original costs.Redemption commissions, redemption charges, and redemption feesYour Form 1099-B will dictate how you should treat the fee and service charges incurred when you sell shares of a mutual fund or individual security. Fidelity's 1099-B deducts the fee from the proceeds. You do, however, have the option of adding the fees to the cost basis. Your gain or loss will be the same in either calculation.Wash salesWash sales can affect your cost basis. If you sell shares at a loss and buy additional shares in the same investment 30 days before or after the sale (a full 61-day range), you are not able to claim the loss on your tax return until you sell the new shares. In these cases, the IRS considers the new shares to have \"washed\" the prior shares. For example, if you have a dividend reinvestment on May 31 and an exchange redemption that results in a loss on June 12 in the same tax year, some or all of the loss from your redemption may be disallowed as a wash sale. The amount of the disallowed loss is added to the cost basis of the new shares. Fidelity makes no warranties with respect to, and specifically disclaims any potential liability resulting from, tax positions which you make in reliance on wash sale information provided by Fidelity. You should consult your tax advisor for additional information which may be relevant to your individual tax situation.Merged fundsIf you own shares in a fund that is then merged with another, your holding period and total cost basis normally are not affected. However, since the number of shares you own following a merger may be different than the number you owned before the merger, the average cost basis per share may change. If this is the case, when calculating gains and losses you must determine the number of shares acquired in each transaction based on the number of shares received in the merger.Transferred shares: inheritances and giftsThe cost basis of inherited shares is generally the value of the shares on the day of the decedent's death. (It is possible, however, that an alternate date should be used; please consult the executor of, or tax advisor to, the estate to determine). To figure the basis of shares received as a gift, you must determine the cost basis of the shares when they were in the hands of the donor immediately prior to the gift. Additionally, you must determine the shares' fair market value at the time you received them. Additional rules may apply, so you should consult your tax advisor for assistance.Return of capitalA return of capital occurs when a fund's distributions exceed its earnings within a fiscal year. Distributions are not taxable when they exceed earnings and are reported on Form 1099-DIV. The total basis of the position is reduced by the amount of the non-taxable distributions, but they do not affect the basis per share of existing shares.",
  "Why is my cost basis unknown?": "Some of the most common reasons cost basis may be categorized as unknown include:Shares were transferred to a Fidelity account from another institution.Shares were transferred between two accounts registered to different Social Security numbers.Shares were transferred between mutual fund accounts and brokerage accounts before August 1993.The shares are in a mutual fund account established before 1987.The shares are mutual fund shares in a brokerage account established before 1982, or general security shares in a brokerage account established before February 1993.The shares are in a mutual fund that merged with another fund, and cost basis was unknown at the time of the merger.The shares were established by a spin-off, a tender, or a merger, and the cost basis was unknown at the time of the action.To update an unknown cost basis, see other FAQ \"Can I enter or edit the cost basis information for a security?\"",
  "What cost basis methods are approved by the IRS?": "The IRS generally identifies two methods for calculating cost basis—the cost basis method and the average basis method. The average basis method is strictly for mutual funds and equities held in certain dividend reinvestment plans.Cost basis method – There are many variations of this method but the fundamental principle is the same: investors must identify the cost of the actual shares sold. This is important because investors may have a portfolio that contains shares purchased at different times or prices. You need to know the purchase price of the shares you sell. Below are two applications of this method.View a list of applications of the cost basis method. You can use any of these variations to establish standing disposal instructions for subsequent sales from your account.Average basis method – The average basis method determines basis by calculating an average cost per share for all purchased shares. Because of the new IRS cost basis reporting regulations, we must separately calculate the average cost of shares you acquired before January 1, 2012 and shares you acquired after that date. The IRS regulations permit this method only when calculating the basis for mutual funds and equities held in certain dividend reinvestment plans. See IRS Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses (PDF), and the Instructions for Form 8949 (PDF). Average basis is Fidelity's default cost basis calculation method for mutual fund sales, redemptions, and exchanges.",
  "How do I calculate cost basis for shares sold under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997?": "The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 created a second mid-term share category, which was subsequently eliminated by tax legislation in 1998. If you sold shares in 1997 using this category, you should contact the IRS or your tax advisor for instructions on calculating cost basis for this sale.",
  "Can I use cost basis information and unrealized gain/loss information from my Open Positions page for tax reporting purposes?": "The cost basis (and related gain and loss) information made available to you on the Open Positions page is not intended, nor should it be construed as legal or tax advice. Fidelity makes no warranties with respect to, and specifically disclaims any potential liability resulting from, tax positions which you might take in reliance on such information. You should consult your tax advisor for additional information which may be relevant to your individual tax situation.The cost basis and unrealized gain/loss information on the Open Positions page may not reflect intraday transactions, including trading activity. When intraday transactions are not included, the message Pending Update will be displayed. The Open Positions page may also not reflect all adjustments necessary for tax reporting purposes. You should verify cost basis and corresponding gain/loss information provided by Fidelity against your own records when calculating reportable gain or loss resulting from a sale. You are solely responsible for the accuracy of cost basis and gain/loss information reported to federal, state, and other taxing authorities. Unless otherwise specified, Fidelity determines cost basis at the time of sale based on the first in, first out (FIFO) method (for unrestricted securities other than open-end mutual funds) or the average cost method (for open-end mutual funds). Consult your tax advisor for further information. Please note that holding period information provided by Fidelity does not reflect the \"5-Year Long-Term Capital Gains\" classification, which took effect for certain tax payers on January 1, 2001.",
  "Can I enter or edit the cost basis information for a security?": "Yes, you may enter or edit cost basis information.

Under the Cost Basis column, you’ll see the \"Edit Cost\" link, which will take you to the Edit Cost Basis page.Note: Updating your cost basis overrides any previously provided cost basis for the selected lots. You cannot update the basis for shares if the cost basis has been provided by Fidelity.",
  "How does Fidelity report wash sale information?": "Unless otherwise specified by you, Fidelity will display cost basis figures that have been adjusted due to previous wash sale disallowed loss. If you sell shares at a loss and you purchase additional shares of a substantially identical security 30 days before or after the sale (within a 61-day window), the purchase may result in the loss being deferred until you sell the newly purchased shares under the wash sale provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.",
  "How can I view my cost basis without wash sale adjustments?": "To view your cost basis information without wash sale adjustments, from the Show dropdown menu, select the Show Unadjusted Cost Basis option. These values may include other adjustments for corporate actions, stock splits, commissions, or other events, which would normally influence the cost basis calculation. These values are supplied as additional views of information and should not be used for tax reporting, or considered to be tax advice.

  "What is an ADR* (American Depositary Receipt) Fee?": "An ADR fee is an American Depositary Receipt (ADR) fee. This fee is not charged by Fidelity. The fee is charged by the ADR agent. ADR prospectuses outline the custody and reclamation fees that agents often are authorized to impose on shareholders. Agents also may impose these fees on HOLDRS,** other equity products, and stock dividend distributions.As of February 2007, pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the SEC, dividend expense fees (if charged) will appear in your account rather than being paid from the dividend itself. Prior to February 2007, ADRs, HOLDRs, and other securities collected the fees by subtracting the amount of the fee from the gross dividend payable to the holders. The fee is processed separately from any foreign tax withholding and reduces the gross dividend amount to a net amount which was paid to the shareholders.The transparency requirement for ADR fees means you may see two separate entries in your account when a dividend is paid. You may see the gross payment of the dividend and then have a separate entry displaying the payment for the expense (ADR) fee. This expense fee is paid to the ADR agent.In some cases, ADR fees can be greater than the amount of the dividend. Please read the prospectus for additional information. If you have questions about potential tax liabilities, please contact a qualified tax advisor regarding dividend withholding and fee allocations.If you participate in a dividend reinvestment program, the gross dividends, minus any foreign withholdings and the fee, are reinvested. You are responsible for the fee amount imposed by the ADR agent. If the ADR does not pay a periodic dividend, a single fee transaction might occur without any corresponding dividend allocations.*A negotiable certificate issued by a U.S. bank representing a specified number of shares (or one share) in a foreign stock that is traded on a U.S. exchange. ADRs are denominated in U.S. dollars, with the underlying security held by a U.S. financial institution overseas. ADRs help to reduce administration and duty costs that would otherwise be levied on each transaction.**HOLDRS (Holding Company Depositary Receipts) are securities that represent an investor's ownership in the common stock or American Depositary Receipts of specified companies in a particular industry, sector, or group.

A call option is considered \"in-the-money\" if the price of the underlying security is higher than the strike price of the call. A put option is considered \"in-the-money\" if the price of the security is lower than the strike price.Real-timeCash covered put reserveThe value required to cover short put options contracts held in a cash account. Cash covered put reserve is equal to the options strike price multiplied by the number of contracts purchased, multiplied by the number of shares per contract (usually 100). Cash available to buy securities, cash available to withdraw, and available to withdraw values will be reduced by this value.IntradayCash spread reserveThe requirement for spread positions held in a retirement account. For debit spreads, the requirement is full payment of the debit. For credit spreads, it's the difference between the strike prices or maximum loss. A $2,000 minimum equity deposit is required in addition to the debit requirement. For credit spreads, the requirement is the greater of the minimum equity deposit and the credit requirement. The $2,000 minimum equity deposit is required when the first spread is established. Maintaining multiple spreads in the same account does not require multiple minimum equity deposits.OvernightOptions balances appear if options agreement exists.Update frequency explained  Real-time: Balances display values that change with market price fluctuations on the underlying securities in your account. Essentially, it is a complete recalculation based on price fluctuations of positions, trade executions, and money movement into or out of the account. Intraday: Balances reflect trade executions and money movement into and out of the account during the day. Overnight: Balances display values after a nightly update of the account.

  "How is my account protected?": "Protecting your account assets Fidelity's brokerage businesses (Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC and National Financial Services LLC [NFS]) are members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), and brokerage accounts maintained with Fidelity are covered by SIPC, which protects brokerage accounts of each customer when a brokerage firm is closed due to bankruptcy or other financial difficulties and customer assets are missing from accounts.SIPC protects brokerage accounts of each customer up to $500,000 in securities, including a limit of $250,000 on claims for cash awaiting reinvestment. Money market funds held in a brokerage account are considered securities.In addition to SIPC protection, Fidelity, through NFS, provides its brokerage customers with additional excess of SIPC coverage from Lloyd's of London together with Axis Specialty Europe Ltd. and Munich Reinsurance Co. The excess of SIPC coverage would only be used when SIPC coverage is exhausted. As with SIPC, excess of SIPC protection does not cover investment losses in customer accounts due to market fluctuation. It also does not cover other claims for losses incurred while broker-dealers remain in business. Total aggregate excess of SIPC coverage available through Fidelity's excess of SIPC policy is $1 billion.Within Fidelity's excess of SIPC coverage, there is no per-account dollar limit on coverage of securities, but there is a per-account limit of $1.9 million on coverage of cash awaiting investment. This is the maximum excess of SIPC protection currently available in the brokerage industry.Both SIPC and excess of SIPC coverage is limited to securities held in brokerage positions, including mutual funds if held in your brokerage account, and securities held in book-entry form. Neither SIPC nor the additional coverage protects against loss of market value of the securities.Note: Certain assets are not eligible for SIPC protection. Among the assets typically not eligible for SIPC protection are commodity futures contracts and precious metals, as well as investment contracts (such as limited partnerships) and fixed annuity contracts that are not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933.In accordance with the SEC rule 15c3-3, often known as the \"Customer Protection Rule,\" Fidelity protects client securities that are fully paid for by segregating them and ensuring that they are not used for any other purpose, such as for loans to investors or institutions, corporate investment purposes, and spending. This practice helps ensure that customers have access to these securities at all times. Customer assets may still be subject to market risk and volatility.Protecting your personal information When you use the Fidelity web site, we want to make sure you have the peace of mind that comes with knowing that your information is safe and secure. That's why we only allow access to your account using confirmed information, such as your Social Security number or a username and password that you've created. We generally recommend using a username and password instead of your Social Security number as that combination can offer increased protection. However, no matter which mode of access you choose, we protect your information using the strongest encryption available to us. We also offer the same encryption when you access your accounts using your mobile device.

  "What is Fidelity's Excessive Trading Policy?": "Fidelity has long discouraged excessive trading by mutual fund investors. Excessive trading can be expensive and burdensome for long-term shareholders. Read the full policy.",
  "How do I know at what price my order will get executed?": "This depends on what type of security you are trading. See the Mutual Funds section above for information about mutual fund pricing.For equity and options trading, the execution price you’ll receive will be dependent on a number of factors. For many equities and options, the most recent price might be from seconds ago, though it could be minutes, hours or even days, for less liquid securities. Instead of relying on the most recent, last trading price, a better indication is the bid price and ask price. The ask price is often referred to as the offer price.The NBBO (National Best Bid and Offer) is a consolidated quote that represents the highest bid and lowest offer for a security across all exchanges and/or market centers. It is updated continuously during market hours. Along with the bid price and ask price, there is also an indication of size, representing how many shares are willing to be bought (bid size) and sold (ask size) at those prices. For equities, the size indicated should be multiplied by 100. A bid size of 5 actually represents 500 shares willing to be purchased at the bid price.If you are placing a market order (hoping to receive the next available price), the NBBO is an indication of the price you could receive. For buy orders, the best offer price is the best indication of the price at which an order is likely to be filled. The best bid price is the best indication of the price at which a sell order will be filled. However, if the size of your buy order is larger than the size available at the ask, you should expect that some of your order might execute at a price higher than the ask.In addition, there are various market conditions that can cause orders to be executed at better or worse prices than the bid and ask. While the bid and ask price are displayed to investors and other market participants, there can also be non-displayed orders at, inside, or outside of the bid and ask prices. There is the potential that your order will execute against a non-displayed order that is resting between the bid and ask, which could improve your execution price. For orders placed prior to market open, Fidelity may wait for the primary exchange to open before commencing trading in a particular security. Also, in fast market conditions, there could be orders ahead of yours that deplete all available shares at the bid or ask, moving prices in or out of your favor by the time you place your trade. News events, market volatility, market outages, and other circumstances can all impact the execution price that you receive. You should always use caution with market orders as securities prices can change sharply.",
  "What is price improvement?": "Price improvement occurs when a market center is able to execute a trade at a price lower than the ask (for buy orders) or higher than the bid (for sell orders). It is associated with trades that are immediately marketable (limit orders that can immediately execute based on current market prices, as well as market orders). In addition to measuring execution speed and the likelihood of your order being filled in its entirety, we strive to send orders to venues that are most likely to be able to price improve orders.",
  "What types of orders are eligible for price improvement?": "Equity, single-leg option, and multi-leg option trades can receive price improvement. Equity and single leg option orders that are executed while the market is open will display an estimate of the total dollar value of price improvement that you received, if any, based on the bid ask at the time your order was submitted. If your order is not immediately marketable, for instance if you place a limit or stop order away from the current bid ask, the price improvement indication will not be displayed. This is because as seconds or minutes pass, market conditions change, and your execution price is more a reflection of those changing conditions than it is of true price improvement.",
  "How is the price improvement indication calculated?": "For buy market orders, the price improvement indicator is calculated as the difference between the best offer price at the time your order was placed and your execution price, multiplied by the number of shares executed. Due to the time difference between when your order is placed versus when it is executed, the best offer price may be different at each of these times. This price improvement calculation should be considered informational and is not used for regulatory reporting purposes.2For example, if the bid ask is $49.95–$50.00 at the time you place your order, and your trade to buy 300 shares executed at $49.99, you received a price improvement of $3.00, compared to the ask price of $50.00.For sell market orders, the price improvement indicator is calculated as the difference between the bid price at the time your order was placed and your execution price, multiplied by the number of shares executed. As noted above, the bid price at the time of order entry may be different from the bid price at the time of order execution; therefore, the price improvement indication may differ from the actual price improvement that your order may receive.For example, if the bid ask is $49.95–$50.00 at the time you place your order, and your trade to sell 300 shares executed at $49.97, you have received a price improvement of $6.00, compared to the bid price of $49.95.Effective December 6, 2015, the calculation for price improvement on limit orders will reflect not only the quoted bid or ask price at the time your order is submitted, but also the limit price that you use. Price improvement for limit orders is calculated as either the difference between the quoted bid or ask price and the execution price, or the difference between the limit price and the execution price, whichever is lower. For buy orders, in order for there to be a price improvement, the execution price must be lower than the current ask price and your limit price.For example, if the bid ask is $49.95–$50.00 at the time you place your order to buy 300 shares at a limit of $49.99, and your order executes at $49.97, you have received a price improvement of $6.00, based on your limit price of $49.99. Had the order executed at $49.99, there would have been zero price improvement since the execution price wasn’t better than both the quoted ask price and your limit price. Alternatively, if you enter an order to buy at a limit of $50.02 and the order executes at $49.97, you have received price improvement of $9.00, based on the ask price of $50.00.Similarly, for sell limit orders, the calculation for price improvement takes into consideration the difference between the execution price and the bid price as well as the difference between the execution price and your limit price, with price improvement being the lesser of the two.For example, if you enter an order to sell 300 shares at a limit of $49.97 when the bid ask is $49.95–$50.00, and the order executes at $49.98, you have received a price improvement of $3.00, based on the limit price of $49.97.In order to help ensure that order execution is the top priority, the quoted bid ask is captured separately from the trade execution process. In rare instances, the quote may not be captured for the price improvement indication calculation by the time the order is executed. When this happens, the price improvement indication will not be calculated on your order.Depending on the price per share and the liquidity of the security, price improvements can be bigger or smaller than the examples provided.For stock and option orders with wide bid-ask spreads, there is a wider range of prices at which your order could execute inside of the spread. With more room between the bid price and ask price, there is the potential, though not a guarantee, that the execution price will be more significantly below the ask or above the bid than for products with tighter bid-ask spreads. In such cases, the price improvement indicator may appear larger than usual. Market conditions are a large contributing factor to the amount of the price improvement indication in these instances.",
  "What does Fidelity do to ensure the best execution price on my orders?": "Fidelity works to ensure that orders receive the best possible execution price by routing orders to a number of competing market centers. This is done by supervising order-flow routing activities, monitoring execution quality, and taking corrective action when venues aren't able to meet our quality standards. To learn more, see our Commitment to Execution Quality.",
  "What is a market order?": "A market order instructs Fidelity to buy or sell securities for your account at the next available price. It remains in effect only for the day, and usually results in the prompt purchase or sale of all the shares of stock, options contracts, or bonds in question, as long as the security is actively traded and market conditions permit.Note: In order to maintain a fair and orderly market, most market centers generally do not accept cancellation requests after 9:28 a.m. ET for market orders eligible for execution at 9:30 a.m. ET, when the market opens. Acceptance of a cancellation request by Fidelity between 9:28 and 9:30 a.m. ET does not guarantee an order cancellation. All requests to cancel an order are processed on a best-efforts basis.",
  "What is a limit order?": "When you place a limit order to buy, the stock is eligible to be purchased at or below your limit price, but never above it.You may place limit orders either for the day on which they are entered (a day order), or for a period that ends when it is executed or when you cancel (an open order or good ’til canceled (GTC) order).Note: All open GTC orders will expire 180 calendar days after they are placed. If the 180th day falls on a weekend or holiday, those orders will expire on the first business day following the expiration day. This policy does not apply to options.Orders at each price level are filled in a sequence that is determined by the rules of the various market centers; therefore, there can be no assurance that all orders at a particular price limit (including yours) will be filled when that price is reached. Such orders are also subject to the existence of a market for that security. Thus, the fact that your price limit was reached does not guarantee an execution.Limit orders for more than 100 shares or for multiple round lots (200, 300, 400, etc.) may be filled completely or in part until completed. It may take more than one trading day to completely fill a multiple round lot or mixed-lot order unless the order is designated as one of the following types:All or none (fill the whole order or no part of it). When you place an all-or-none designation on your order, it is considered restricted. The stock can trade at or below your price on a buy, or at or above on a sell, without the right to execution, unless the entire amount of your order is executable.Immediate or cancel (fill the whole order or any part immediately, and cancel any unfilled balance).Fill or kill (fill the entire order immediately or cancel it).Note: Good ’til canceled time in force is not available for short sales, unlisted corporate bonds and treasuries, mortgage-backed and agency bonds, and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs).

  "What is a stop order?": "Stop orders are generally used to protect a profit or to prevent further loss if the price of a security moves against you. They can also be used to establish a position in a security if it reaches a certain price threshold or to close a short position.The specialists on the various exchanges and market makers have the right to refuse stop orders under certain market conditions. Not all securities or trading sessions (pre- and post-market) are eligible for stop orders.Types of stop ordersStop loss This type of order automatically becomes a market order when the stop price is reached. Therefore, there is no guarantee that your order will be executed at the stop price.It is important for investors to understand that company news or market conditions can have a significant impact on the price of a security. This could result in a stop loss order being executed at a price that is dramatically different than what your stop loss price indicates.Stop limit This type of order automatically becomes a limit order when the stop price is reached. Like any limit order, a stop limit order may be filled in whole, in part, or not at all, depending on the number of shares available for sale or purchase at the time.Note: Buy stop loss and buy stop limit orders must be entered at a price which is above the current market price. Sell stop loss and sell stop limit orders must be entered at a price which is below the current market price.How stop orders are triggeredStocks Equity stop orders placed with Fidelity are triggered off of a round lot transaction of 100 shares or greater, or a print in the security. The market centers to which National Financial Services (NFS) routes Fidelity stop loss orders and stop limit orders may impose price limits such as price bands around the National Best Bid or Offer (NBBO) in order to prevent stop loss orders and stop limit orders from being triggered by potentially erroneous trades. These price limits may vary by market center. If you are interested in placing an order which triggers off of a bid quote or ask quote, please see Trailing Stop Orders and Contingent Orders.Options Generally a stop order to buy becomes a market order when the bid price is at or above the stop price, or the option trades at or above the stop price. A stop order to sell becomes a market order when the ask price is at or below the stop price, or when the option trades at or below the stop price. The options stop election is based on the exchange’s best bid or offer (BBO) where the stop order resides.",
  "What time limitations can I place on an order?": "You place a time limitation on a stock trade order by selecting one of the following time-in-force types:Day A time-in-force limitation on the execution of an order. This limitation has a default order expiration time of 4:00 p.m. ET. You may select your own order expiration time between 10:00 a.m. ET and 4:00 p.m. ET in thirty minute increments (i.e., 10:00 a.m., 10:30 a.m., 11:00 a.m., etc). If all or part of your order is not executed by the time you’ve selected for expiration, your order will be canceled. You may view the status of your order, including order expiration date and/or time, on the Orders page.Good 'til canceled A time-in-force limitation that can be placed on a stock or ETF order. This limitation has a default order expiration date of 180 calendar days from the order entry date at 4:00 p.m. ET.

  "How are commissions assessed for good until canceled orders?": "The commission for a good 'til canceled order is assessed at the time your order is executed.If your order receives multiple executions on a single day, you will be assessed one commission. For good 'til canceled orders that receive executions over multiple days, a commission is assessed for each day in which there is an execution.Good 'til canceled orders that do not execute are not charged a commission.",
  "How do dividend distributions affect open orders?": "Although different exchange rules may exist for adjusting orders when a security pays a dividend, the general rule is that good 'til canceled (GTC) orders below the market are adjusted for the dividend amount. The price of your order will be automatically reduced on the \"ex-dividend\" date by approximately the amount of the upcoming dividend unless you note it as a do not reduce (DNR) when you place the order. Orders below the market include: buy limit, sell stop loss, sell stop limit, sell trailing stop loss, sell trailing stop limit.",
  "What are the risks of trading in volatile markets?": "Volatile markets can present higher trading risks, especially when you are using electronic services to access information or place orders.Consider placing limit orders instead of market orders. In certain market conditions, or with certain types of securities offerings (such as IPOs and financial stocks), price changes may be significant and rapid during regular or after-hours trading. In these cases, placing a market order could result in a transaction that exceeds your available funds, meaning that Fidelity would have the right to sell other assets in your account to cover any outstanding debt. This is a particular risk in accounts that you cannot easily add money to, such as retirement accounts.Be aware that quotes, order executions, and execution reports could be delayed. During periods of heavy trading or volatility, quotes that are provided as “real time” may be stale—even if they appear not to be—and you may not receive every quote update. Security prices can change dramatically during such delays.When canceling an order, be sure your original order is actually canceled (verified canceled order status) before entering a replacement order. Don’t rely on a receipt for your cancellation order; that order may have arrived too late for us to act on. Cancellation requests are handled on a best-efforts basis.Use other ways to access Fidelity during peak volume times. System availability and response time may be subject to market conditions. If you are having problems reaching us one way, try another. There are several ways to contact Fidelity.The chances of encountering these risks are higher for individuals using day trading strategies. In part for this reason, Fidelity does not promote day trading strategies. For more information on trading risks and how to manage them, contact Fidelity.",
  "What is a Trailing Stop Order?": "Trailing Stop Orders adjust automatically when market conditions move in your favor, and can help protect profits while providing downside protection. With a Trailing Stop Order, you do not have to constantly adjust for price changes.Additionally, Trailing Stop Orders may have increased risks due to their reliance on trigger processing, market data, and other internal and external system factors. These orders are held in a separate order file with Fidelity and are not sent to the marketplace until the order conditions you've defined have been met.Eligible securities:Listed and OTC EquitiesSingle-leg OptionsTypes of Trailing Stop Orders:Trailing Stop Loss: Once triggered, the order will become a market order.Trailing Stop Limit: Once triggered, the order will become a limit order.Trailing Stop Order trigger values:You may elect to trigger a Trailing Stop order based on the following security market activities:The security's last round lot trade of 100 shares or greater (default)The security's bid priceThe security's ask priceTrailing Stop Order time limits:Trailing Stop orders can be either Day orders or Good 'til Canceled (GTC) orders.GTC orders placed on Fidelity.com expire after 180 days.Trailing Stop Order trail values:Equity Trailing Stop orders can be set with a percentage (%) or dollar ($) trail value.Single-leg Option Trailing Stop orders can only be set with a dollar ($) trail value.Important information regarding Trailing Stop Orders.Example of a Trailing Stop Order1. You buy XYZ stock at $25 per share. 2. XYZ rises to $27. 3. You place a sell trailing stop loss with a trail value of $1. 4. As long as the price moves in your favor, your trailing price will stay $1 away. 5. The price of XYZ peaks at $29, then starts to drop. Your trailing stop loss remains at $28. 6. Shares are sold when XYZ reaches $28.",
  "What is a conditional order?": "A conditional order allows you to set order triggers for stocks and options based on the price movement of stocks, indices, or options contracts. There are five types: Contingent, Multi-Contingent, One-Triggers-the-Other (OTO), One-Cancels-the-Other (OCO), and One-Triggers-a-One-Cancels-the-Other (OTOCO).ContingentA Contingent order triggers an equity or options order based on any 1 of 8 trigger values for any stock, up to 40 selected indices, or any valid options contract.Trigger values: last trade, bid, ask, volume, change % up, change % down, 52-week high, and 52-week lowMarket, limit, stop loss, and trailing stop loss are available order types once the contingent criterion is met.Security type: Stock or single-leg optionsTime-in-force: For the contingent criteria and for the triggered order, it can be for the day, or good 'til canceled (GTC). The time-in-force for the contingent criteria does not need to be the same as the time-in-force for the triggered order.Example of a Contingent Order1. You place a Contingent order to buy XYZ stock at a limit of $25—if the UVW index moves up more than 1.25%. 2. A rally occurs that pushes the index up 1.30% on the day… 3. …which triggers a limit order to buy XYZ at $25. 4. XYZ hits your limit of $25 so shares are bought.Multi-Contingent  A Multi-Contingent order triggers an equity or option order based on a combination of 2 trigger values for any stock or up to 40 selected indices. The criteria can be linked by “And at the same time,” “Or,” or “Then.”“And at the same time” is chosen if both criteria must be met at the same time.“Or” is chosen if either one of the two criteria must be met.“Then” is chosen if the criteria must be met in sequential order.Trigger values: last trade, bid, ask, volume, change % up, change % down, 52-week high, and 52-week lowSecurity type: Stock or single-leg optionsTime-in-force: For the contingent criteria and for the triggered order, it can be for the day, or good ’til canceled (GTC). The time-in-force for the contingent criteria does not need to be the same as the time-in-force for the triggered order.Example of a Multi-Contingent Order1. You purchase XYZ at $25 and place a Multi-Contingent order to sell XYZ at the market if… 2A. … XYZ’s last trade is less than $20… 2B. …or XYZ hits a new 52-week high of $32. 3. XYZ moves up to $32 which triggers your order to sell. You order fills at $32.01.One-Triggers-the-Other (OTO)A One-Triggers-the-Other order actually creates both a primary and a secondary order. If the primary order executes, the secondary order automatically triggers.This type of order can help you save time: place a buy order as your primary order and a corresponding sell limit, sell stop, or sell trailing stop at the same time. Or, if you trade options regularly, use an OTO order to leg into a buy-write or covered-call position.Trailing stop orders are available for either or both legs of the OTO.Security type: Any combination of stock and/or single-leg optionsTime-in-force: Can be different for each orderFor OTO orders that are good ’til canceled (GTC), the whole order is good for 180 days (e.g., if the primary order executes on day 30, the secondary order is live for 150 days).If the primary order is canceled, the secondary order is also canceled.If the secondary order is canceled, the primary order remains open as a separate order.Example of One-Triggers-the-Other Order1. You place an OTO to buy XYZ at $30 and sell at a $2 trailing stop loss. 2. The stock drops to $30, which triggers a buy order of XYZ stock that executes and… 3. …a sell trailing stop loss order with a $2 trail is placed with an initial trigger price of $28. 4. XYZ moves up to $35… 5. …so the new trigger price for the trailing stop order is $33. 6. XYZ trades down to $33, which triggers the trailing stop order and shares are sold at the market.One-Cancels-the-Other (OCO)With a One-Cancels-the-Other (OCO) order, two orders are live so that if either executes, the other is automatically triggered to cancel.When orders are placed for retirement accounts, a price-reasonability check helps prevent both OCO orders from executing in a fast market. This feature does not exist in nonretirement accounts.Security type: Any combination of stocks or single-leg optionsTime-in-force: Must be the same for both ordersOrders can be for the same shares of the same stock or option contracts, but on opposite sides of the market (sell limit and sell stop).Example of One-Cancels-the-Other Order1. You buy XYZ stock at $23. 2. XYZ stock rises to $25. 3. You place an OCO with a sell order of $27 and… 4. …a sell stop at $24. 5. XYZ stock hits $27, so your sell order executes and… 6. …your sell stop order is canceled.One-Triggers-a-One-Cancels-the-Other (OTOCO)With a One-Triggers-a-One-Cancels-the-Other order, you place a primary order which, if executed, triggers two secondary orders.If either of these secondary orders executes, the other is automatically canceled.Security type: Any combination of stocks or single-leg optionsTime-in-force: Primary can be different than both secondary orders. However, both secondary orders must have the same time-in-force.Example of One-Triggers-a-One-Cancels-the-Other Order1. You place an order to buy XYZ at $25. 2. At the same time, you place two sell orders, one at stop loss for $23 and one at a limit of $27. 3. XYZ trades at $25. 4. Your buy order executes. 5. Simultaneously, your two sell orders are triggered. 6. XYZ drops to $23. 7. Your stop loss order executes and your limit order is automatically canceled.",
  "What is short selling?": "Short selling is an advanced trading technique that allows you to integrate a number of different strategies into your overall investment approach so that you may potentially profit from downward moves in a particular stock. Fidelity customers with a margin agreement in place may enter short sale and buy-to-cover orders for any U.S. stock using our online trading platform. All short sale orders are subject to the availability of the stock being sold, which must be confirmed by our stock loan department prior to the order being entered.Potential uses of short selling:Hedge current portfolio by short selling similar stocks or ETFs when you think the market may go down in the short term but don’t want to sell the stocks you own to incur short-term capital gains.Profit from the decline of a particular stock, an entire industry, or the overall market.Extend a bearish position when in-the-money calls you’ve written are exercised.Example of a Short Sale1. Seller shorts stock at price A. Fidelity finds shares that can be borrowed for delivery. 2. Three trading days later, on settlement date, Fidelity provides shares for delivery. Seller then pays a variable interest rate on loan of shares for as long as the short position is maintained. 3. Seller enters a buy to cover order at price B. If the price is above the price at which it was originally sold short (B1), the short seller generally realizes a loss. If it is below the original selling price (B2), the short seller generally realizes a profit.* *Note that other factors may have an impact on profit or loss of the trade.",
  "What is a basket?": "A basket is a group of up to 50 stocks that you can trade, manage, and track as one entity.Basket trading user agreement",
  "What are the advantages of basket trading?": "Personalized investment criteria – Create baskets of stocks that fit your criteria or investment needs. For example, create baskets by sector, investment style, market capitalization, life event, your goals, etc.Automated allocation – The automated allocation of basket trading allows you to quickly assign an equal dollar amount or number of shares to each security you want to purchase. Use this feature to quickly distribute your investment across multiple securities.Integrated performance tracking – Because you can track the performance of basket trades as a group, baskets are useful if you want to invest in a number of securities from one sector or industry and then track the performance in your portfolio.Save and review – You can save your baskets when you create them and return to them later to place your trades or make additional modifications.Place multiple trades at once – Buy or make multiple updates to your positions within your basket with just one order.Total control – Buy and sell securities from your basket at your discretion. Control the timing and tax implications of your basket transactions.Specific tax lots – Assign specific share tax lots to your sales online—after submitting your order.",
  "What are the fees, minimums and commissions when trading in a basket?": "There are no additional fees for basket trading. There is a $2,000 minimum to purchase a basket, but the value of the basket does not need to be maintained at $2,000 (e.g., if the value of the stocks falls) and there is no minimum for subsequent orders. Commissions will be charged according to the commission schedule applicable to the account. Each purchase or sale of a security position in a basket is treated as an individual transaction and will be subject to separate transaction commissions.",
  "What types of orders can I place?": "You can place market orders on listed and over-the-counter (OTC) equities in the basket trading application.",
  "How do I cancel a basket?": "All orders in a basket are market orders. You can attempt to cancel an individual order from the Order Details screen if an order has not executed, and re-enter a new order in basket trading. However, use caution when entering the new order as most market orders receive an execution.Cancel and replace functionality is not available on basket trades.",
  "What if an order in my basket cannot be executed?": "Although all buy and sell orders through the basket trading product are market orders, there is the possibility that certain orders will not be executed. For example, if a security that you are trading as part of a basket had halted trading at the time of order entry and did not resume trading through market close, this security would not be part of your purchased basket.The weightings on remaining positions that were purchased will not adjust to account for the unpurchased position(s). For example: You have entered a share weighted order to purchase an 11-security basket at 100 shares for each position. If one of the securities did not execute, the 100 shares that were assigned to that position will not distribute across the 10 positions that did execute, making them 110 share orders. The 10 positions that did execute will remain 100 shares each.You can attempt to buy/sell the security that did not execute in the basket at another time. However, in all cases, unexecuted market orders will not carry over to the next trading session; they will need to be re-entered if you would like them to be part of a basket or to be removed from a basket.",
  "How can I track gain and loss of securities in my basket?": "Baskets display unrealized net change detail for both purchased and saved baskets. Purchased baskets will display a current market value of the basket in its entirety as well as for individual positions. Although the percent net change of a purchased basket will account for additional purchases, liquidations, and certain corporate actions, it does not provide true tax cost basis of your positions within the basket.Securities that are liquidated entirely from a basket will not be tracked in basket detail. You can view cost detail for individual positions within a basket from the unrealized net change screen.",
  "How do I use watch baskets?": "After you construct a basket and indicate the amount you are planning to allocate to the basket, you can either place a trade for the securities in the basket or save the basket for review, tracking, or subsequent purchase. You can save up to 20 baskets in the basket trading application. You can continue to make adjustments to the contents of the basket before you decide to purchase it.Watch baskets display net change detail based on current market value versus market value as of the last time you saved the watch basket.",

  "Is there any rounding involved in the average price process?": "The average price process rounds the average price trade record to the nearest hundredth of a penny per share. If the thousandths of a penny is 5 or greater, it is rounded up to the nearest hundredth of a penny. If the thousandths of a penny is less than 5, it is rounded down to the nearest hundredth of a penny. This process results in thousandths of a penny differences in the cost or proceeds per share of your order. Rounding up results in higher proceeds for sells and higher cost for buys. Rounding down results in lower proceeds for sells and lower cost for buys.",

  "What securities are eligible for margin?": "The following securities can be used as collateral for margin borrowing:Equities and ETFs trading over $3 a share (special requirements exist for certain securities and accounts)Most mutual funds that have been held for at least 30 daysTreasury, corporate, municipal, and government agency bondsThe following are not eligible for margin borrowing:CDs, money market funds, annuities, options, precious metals, and offshore mutual fundsUGMA/UTMA or retirement accounts",
  "How does margin work?": "Margin borrowing lets you leverage securities you already own to purchase additional securities. By leveraging your assets, you can potentially realize greater investment returns.Example: Suppose you use $5,000 in cash and borrow $5,000 on margin to purchase a total of $10,000 in stock. If the stock rises in value to $11,000 and you sell it, you would pay back the $5,000 borrowed on margin and realize a profit of $1,000. That’s a 20% return on your $5,000 investment.If you didn’t take advantage of the margin loan, you would have paid $10,000 in cash for the stock. Not only would you have tied up an additional $5,000, but you would have realized only a 10% return on your investment. The 10% difference in the return is the result of leveraging your assets.1Example of How Leverage Can Improve Your Return Using cash onlyUsing margin creditSecurities purchased$10,000$10,000Cash provided$10,000$5,000Margin credit$0$5,000Sales proceeds$11,000$11,000Gain$1,000$1,000Cash provided$10,000$5,000Return on investment10%20%",
  "What are the risks associated with margin?": "Margin investing carries greater risks and may not be appropriate for every investor. Before you use margin, carefully review your investment objectives, financial resources, and risk tolerance to determine whether margin borrowing is appropriate for you.Leverage riskLeverage works as dramatically when stock prices fall as when they rise. For example, let’s say you use $5,000 in cash and borrow $5,000 on margin to purchase a total of $10,000 in stock. Suppose the market value of the stock you’ve purchased for $10,000 drops to $9,000. Your equity would fall to $4,000, which is the market value minus the loan balance of $5,000. In this instance, you could suffer a loss of 20% due to a 10% decrease in market value.1Maintenance call riskIf the securities you hold fall below the minimum maintenance requirement, your account may incur a margin call. Margin calls are due immediately. It’s smart to leave a cash cushion in your account to help reduce the likelihood of a margin call.Sometimes you may face higher maintenance minimums, especially when the securities you’re holding carry additional risks, such as concentration risk.",
  "What is a margin call?": "If the margin equity in your account falls below a certain amount based on the amount you have borrowed, then the account is issued a margin call.Margin call information is provided to help you understand when your account is in a call and see what amounts are due and when. The method and time for meeting a margin call varies, depending on the type of call.Call typeTriggerCall meeting methodsHouseAccount margin equity falls below Fidelity’s requirement.Sell margin-eligible securities held in the account, orDeposit cash or margin-eligible securities.Time allowed: 5 business daysFidelity reserves the right to meet margin calls in your account at any time without prior notice.2ExchangeAccount margin equity falls below exchange requirements.Sell margin-eligible securities held in the account, orDeposit cash or margin-eligible securities.Time allowed: 2 business daysFidelity reserves the right to meet margin calls in your account at any time without prior notice.2FederalEquity is insufficient to satisfy the 50% initial requirement on an opening transaction.Sell margin-eligible securities held in the account, orDeposit cash or margin-eligible securities.Note: Repeatedly liquidating securities to cover a federal call while below exchange requirements may result in restrictions on margin trading in the account.Time allowed: 5 business daysFidelity reserves the right to meet margin calls in your account at any time without prior notice.2Day tradeA day trade exceeds your account’s day trade buying power.Deposit of cash or marginable securities only.

  "What are the types of margin requirements?": "Margin requirements are intended to help protect securities firms and their customers from some of the risks associated with leveraging investments by requiring customers to either meet or maintain certain levels of equity in their account.There are two primary types of margin requirements: initial and maintenance.Initial/Reg T requirementsAn initial margin requirement is the amount of funds required to satisfy a purchase or short sale of a security in a margin account. The initial margin requirement is currently 50% of the purchase price for most securities, and it is known as the Reg T or the Fed requirement, which is set by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, Fidelity requires customers to have a minimum account equity of $2,000 when placing orders on margin.Maintenance requirementsOngoing margin requirements after the purchase is complete are known as maintenance requirements, which require that you maintain a certain level of equity in your margin account. Maintenance requirements are set by the NYSE, FINRA, and/or the brokerage firm.At Fidelity, house maintenance requirements are systematically applied based on the composition of an account. These are called rules-based requirements (RBR). RBR applies changes to requirements based on the changes in the positions held in an account on a daily basis. In this way, the aggregate requirement truly reflects the risk in an account based on the current structure of the portfolio. Fidelity, as well as other broker dealers, has the right to modify the maintenance requirements on specific securities and individual customer accounts.RBR is applied to accounts with a margin debit balance greater than $10,000 or any short position in a margin or short account. Accounts that do not meet these criteria will receive base requirements. RBR is applied to stocks, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, treasuries, and preferred stock. Options requirements are not impacted by RBR.RBR examines individual accounts and calculates requirements based on portfolio attributions (add-on percentages), which are added to the existing base requirements. RBR requirements are additive, i.e., any one security could qualify for more than just one type of add-on with a maximum requirement of 100%. The account level add-ons are:Issuer (position) concentration: Concentration of a position held versus the account’s gross market value.Liquidity: Concentration based on the trading volume of a security.Ownership concentration: Concentration based on all the securities held of a common issuer.Industry concentration: Concentration based on all the securities held in a common industry.Fidelity provides the margin maintenance requirement for all securities held in your account. Fidelity also provides the ability for you to enter symbols to retrieve the maintenance requirement for securities not held in your account, as well as evaluate the impact of hypothetical trades on your account balances using our margin calculator.Note: All margin maintenance requirements displayed using the “margin requirement” tool are specific to the margin account through which you access the tool. Maintenance requirements may vary by account and may be subject to RBR add-on requirements in addition to the base requirements. Fidelity requires customers to have a minimum account equity of $2,000 when placing orders on margin.With respect to maintenance requirements on specific securities, Fidelity considers a number of factors, including the stock’s trading volatility and liquidity, company earnings and market capitalization, as well as whether the account in question is in a concentrated position.Example: If you purchase $20,000 of marginable stock with a 30% house margin requirement, you would need to initially deposit $10,000, which is the 50% Fed requirement. You would not need to deposit additional money beyond the $10,000 because the house maintenance requirement is below the 50% Fed requirement.Let’s say, however, the security purchased now makes up 80% of the gross market value of your portfolio. This security would be subject to an RBR add-on of 30%, bringing the house requirement to 60%. Since the account has a maintenance requirement higher than the Fed requirement, you would need to deposit funds to meet the higher requirement, rather than 30%. In this example, the security purchased increased the house maintenance requirement to 60%, requiring a deposit totaling $12,000. This amount is equal to 60% of the purchase price.Note: Fidelity may impose a higher house maintenance requirement than the Fed requirement (or Reg T). In a situation where the maintenance requirement is the greater of the two, you must maintain an equity level at or above the higher requirement.",
  "What are the requirements for equities?": "Maintenance requirements are calculated using rules-based requirements in which the RBR add-ons are added to the base requirements. A majority of securities have base requirements of:30% (long side)35% (short side)There may be instances where securities have higher base requirements. Some examples are distressed sectors, distressed issuers, and levered ETFs.Issuer (Position) ConcentrationThe market value of a position as a percent of the account’s gross market value (position market value/portfolio gross market value)Long positionsLevel of concentrationAdd-on0%–10%0%10.01%–20%5%20.01%–40%10%40.01%–50%15%50.01%–75%20%75.01%–100%30%Short positionsLevel of concentrationAdd-on0%–10%0%10.01%–20%10%20.01%–40%15%40.01%–50%20%50.01%–75%30%75.01%–100%35%LiquidityThe quantity of a position as a percent of the security’s 20-day average trading volume (position quantity/security’s 20-day average volume)Long sideDays to liquidateAdd-on0–10%1.01–210%2.01–320%3.01–530%above 550%Short sideDays to liquidateAdd-on0–10%1.01–210%2.01–320%3.01–530%above 550%Ownership concentrationThe quantity of a position as a percent of the number of shares outstanding (position quantity/shares outstanding)OwnershipAdd-on0%–1%0%1.01%–3%10%3.01%–5%25%5.01%–100%100%Industry ConcentrationThe net market value of position(s) in the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) as a percent of the account’s gross market value (net market value in each GICS sub sector/gross market value)Level of concentration (within same industry)Add-on0%–30%0%30.01%–70%5%70.01%–100%10%Note: The industry add-on should only trigger for an account that has no positions greater than 40% of total market value.",

  "What is portfolio margin?": "Portfolio margin is another method of calculating margin requirements. Unlike the traditional Initial/Regulation T (Reg T) margin calculation method, portfolio margin measures the risk in your overall portfolio and uses that to determine your margin requirement. As a result of these calculations, margin requirements may be as low as 15% for a well-diversified account with long and short market exposure. Since portfolio margin measures overall portfolio risk, it is best suited for a well-diversified portfolio. If a portfolio is heavily invested in an individual stock or sector, higher margin requirements may be placed on the account in question. An account that uses portfolio margin is not subject to Initial/Reg T margin requirements.It is important to note that not all securities are marginable. However, you can still hold these non-marginable securities in your portfolio margin account, but they must be paid for in full.Buying power for portfolio margin accounts is calculated by taking either your exchange or house surplus (whichever is lower), adding your net cash positions (cash in your core account plus any cash credit or debit balance, and excluding non-core money market funds), and multiplying the sum by 4. For example, say you have $12,000 in exchange surplus, $10,000 in house surplus, and net cash of $5,000. When calculating your margin, we’d take the $10,000 in house surplus, add your net cash of $5,000, and multiply by 4. Your buying power in this example would be $60,000, meaning you would be able to purchase up to that amount of a fully marginable security. However, keep in mind, depending on your existing positions, if investing the entire $60,000 into a single position results in a concentrated position, additional margin requirements may apply.",
  "What are the requirements for opening a portfolio margin account?": "To be approved for portfolio margin, your account must have a total account value of at least $150,000. This is the minimum equity balance that is required on an ongoing basis.Additionally, your account should be significantly diversified. If your account is heavily invested in a small number of securities or sectors, it may not qualify for portfolio margin.Note that there are additional application criteria. For instance, while day-trading isn't prohibited in a portfolio margin account, it cannot be the primary investment strategy. In addition, accounts that make frequent withdrawals or large withdrawals relative to the overall account value, may not qualify for portfolio margin. These withdrawals include transfers to other accounts, check writing, and other cash management activities.",
  "How do I apply for portfolio margin?": "To apply for portfolio margin, please call 800-544-6666. Our representatives will walk you through the application process, which includes completing an interview questionnaire. You will also need to sign and return the Portfolio Margin Supplemental Account Agreement.Our application review process includes a review of your application, your financial suitability, and a credit check by our Risk Management Credit Committee. Generally, the process takes 5–7 business days.Once your application has been reviewed, a Fidelity representative will notify you of its status.",
  "Are portfolio margin accounts subject to margin calls?": "Yes, portfolio margin accounts are subject to margin maintenance, minimum equity, and pattern day trade calls.Margin maintenance calls arise when an account holds positions whose value exceeds the account holder's house or exchange surplus. Once a maintenance call has been issued, the account holder generally has 1 business day to meet the call; otherwise the account is subject to liquidation. In cases where a large margin call is issued or an account has a low equity percentage relative to its margin requirements, the account may be liquidated in less than 1 business day.If the value of a portfolio margin account falls below the minimum account equity requirement of $150,000, a minimum equity call is issued. In the event this happens, the account holder has 3 business days to bring the account back into compliance. If this doesn’t happen, the account holder will be restricted from opening new positions or adding to current positions in that account. If the value of the account is still below $150,000 after 30 days from the issuance of the minimum equity call, the portfolio margin feature will be removed from the account, and the account will become subject to Reg T margin requirements. Removal of portfolio margin approval from an account can result in the issuance of a margin call.Portfolio margin accounts are also subject to pattern day trade rules. If the account holder day trades more than 4 times his or her start-of-day exchange surplus, plus 4 times the start-of-day net cash at any given time during the day, a day trade call is issued. This amount is lower for non-marginable securities, and securities with increased exchange requirements. Portfolio margin accounts have 3 business days to meet a day trade call.",
  "What is limited margin?": "Limited margin allows you to trade on unsettled funds and trade without triggering trading restrictions, such as good faith violations, in an IRA. Limited margin does not allow for borrowing against existing holdings, account leveraging, creating cash or margin debits, short selling of securities, or selling naked options. It allows for day trading of stocks and options (option agreement required) in your IRA.",
  "What account registrations are eligible for limited margin?": "Only the following IRA registrations are eligible for limited margin:Traditional IRARollover IRARoth IRASEP IRASIMPLE IRA",
  "What are the eligibility requirements for limited margin?": "You must enroll in limited margin  online.A total account value of $25,000 or greater is required.IRAs with an FDIC core are ineligible. Please contact a representative for ways to change your core account.IRAs with a day trade restriction are ineligible. See Trading Restrictions for more information.Your IRA investment objective must be Most Aggressive. You can update your investment objective in your Financial Profile .",
  "How does it work?": "TradingOnce you complete the online enrollment process, limited margin is immediately available on your account if you have greater than $25,000 in core. However, if you have less than $25,000 in your core, your Intraday Buying Power balance will be zero, which will prevent you from day trading. You can contact a Fidelity representative to have your positions moved to Margin. Otherwise, this will happen automatically the following business day.You can continue to use the trade tickets on Fidelity.com (i.e., Trade Stocks/ETFs, Trade Options, and Trade Conditional) to place your orders. However, a new Margin Trade Type radio button will appear and be the default for orders placed in your IRA. Securities intended to be day traded must be placed in the trade type, Margin; otherwise, you'll be subject to cash account trading restrictions.* See Trading Restrictions for more information.Note: Proceeds from margin positions held overnight and liquidated the next business day are not available to be purchased in the margin trade type until the following business day (trade date + 1 day). For example, let's say you purchased symbol XYZ in margin on Monday and held it overnight, then you sold symbol XYZ on Tuesday morning. The proceeds from this sale would not be available for additional purchases in the margin account type until Wednesday.*Orders in trade type Margin can only be placed through Fidelity.com, but you can check the status of these orders and straight cancel them through other front-end applications such as ATP, ATP.com and mobile devices, or through a Fidelity representative. Balances After enrolling in limited margin, you will see some new balances in your IRA.On the Balances page, under the Limited Margin in the Cash Available to Trade section, there will be two new balances: Intraday Buying Power and Day Trade Buying Power (Start of Day).Intraday Buying PowerThis balance field only applies to pattern day trade accounts and limited margin accounts and is the amount that can be used to buy stock or options intended to be day traded. Unlike Day Trade Buying Power, this value does update intraday to reflect day trade executions, money movement into and out of the account, core cash, and buying power allocated to open orders.Day Trade Buying Power (Start of Day)This balance field only applies to pattern day trade accounts and limited margin accounts. It represents a start-of-day value and does not update during the course of the trading day to reflect trade executions or money movement. A pattern day trade account or limited margin account is required to maintain minimum margin equity of $25,000. If the margin equity falls below this value, this field name will change to Minimum Equity Call and the value indicated will show what is due to meet the minimum equity requirement.Margin callsDay trade minimum equity callIf the equity in your IRA falls below $25,000, a day trade minimum equity call will be issued which will limit you to closing transactions only (sell orders) in the margin account type. This $25,000 minimum must be restored within five business days with a deposit of cash or marginable securities (annual IRA contribution limits apply). If the day trade minimum equity call is not met, then your day trade buying power will be restricted for 90 days. Note that there is a two-business-day holding period on funds deposited to meet a day trade minimum equity call or day trade call.Day trade callA day trade call is generated whenever opening trades (buy orders) exceed the account's day trade buying power and are sold on the same day. Accounts with an open day trade call will lose time and tick and the day trading buying power will be reduced by half. The day trade call amount must be met within five business days with a deposit of cash or marginable securities (annual IRA contribution limits apply). If the day trade is not met, then your day trade buying power will be restricted for 90 days. Note that there is a two-business-day holding period on funds deposited to meet a day trade minimum equity call or day trade call.The sale of an existing position may satisfy a day trade call but is considered a day trade liquidation. Three day trade liquidations within a 12-month period will cause the account to be restricted.Restricted accounts will be limited to closing transactions only (sell orders) in the margin account type. Buy orders in the cash account may be permitted, but are subject to normal cash trading rules.",
  "What is the difference between my cash account and a margin account?": "All new accounts are established as cash accounts unless you have submitted a margin application and been approved for margin trading. Because margin accounts allow for trading on credit, they have several balance fields that cash accounts would not have. Accounts identified by trade activity as pattern day trade accounts also include balance fields not displayed for other account types.",

Whether the balance field indicates credit or debit, the amount is always represented as a positive value. For example, if you have money due to you from the execution of trades in your margin account, the amount owed to you is displayed as a margin credit. If instead, you owe money from the execution of trades in your margin account, the amount you owe is displayed as a margin debit. Both values display as positive numbers, and the field name (in this example, Margin Credit or Margin Debit) reflects whether the value is a credit or debit to your account.",

Executed buy orders and cash withdrawals will reduce the core, and executed sell orders and cash deposits will increase the core.OvernightCash credit/cash debitA cash credit is an amount that will be credited to (positive value) the core at trade settlement. A cash debit is an amount that will be debited to (negative value) the core at trade settlement.IntradaySecurities held in cashThe total market value of all long cash account positions. This figure is reduced by the value of any in-the-money covered options and does not include shares bought on margin, shares held short, or cash in the core money market.Real-timeMargin credit/debitA margin credit indicates the amount due to you based on margin trade executions or an amount needed to meet margin requirements. On settlement date, this amount would be journaled to your core if there is surplus in the margin account. A margin debit indicates the amount you owe Fidelity based on margin trade executions. If there is cash in your core, a journal would take place on settlement date to reduce this debit balance. If there was not enough cash in the core, you would start paying margin interest on this value at settlement.IntradaySecurities held in marginThe total market value of all long margin account positions. This figure is reduced by the value of any in-the-money covered options and does not include shares held as cash positions, shares held short, or cash in the core money market.Real-timeHeld in optionsThe market value of all long and short options positions held in the account.Real-timeShort credit/short debitA short credit is the amount of money held aside to close short positions in an account. This value is compared against the market value of securities held short, and is marked to market weekly. If the market value of the securities held short increases (moves against you), it will cost more to close short positions, and money will be journaled (transferred) from margin and increase the short credit balance. If the market value of securities held short decreases (moves in your favor), it will cost less to close short positions, and money will be journaled (transferred) out of the short credit to margin. When a short position was covered and there were insufficient funds held as a short credit to cover the position, a short debit occurs instead of a short credit. This debit would be cleared with the mark to market following settlement.IntradaySecurities held shortThe total market value of all positions held short in the account. This figure is reduced by the value of any in-the-money covered options and does not include shares held as cash or margin positions, or cash in the core money market.Real-timeDaily mark to marketThe difference between the short credit balance and the market value of securities held short balance, which reflects whether short positions have decreased in price and moved in your favor (positive value), or increased in price and moved against you (negative value), on a daily basis. This balance does not impact the weekly mark to market which is calculated each Friday morning. See the short credit/short debit balance definition for more information about this weekly process. Note: Unsettled short positions are not reflected in the daily mark to market balance.Real-timeAvailable to tradeIntraday buying powerThis balance field applies only to pattern day trade accounts. Unlike day trade buying power, this value does update intraday to reflect day trade executions, money movement into and out of the account, core cash, and buying power allocated to open orders.IntradayMargin buying power (fully marginable securities)The maximum dollar amount available, including both cash and margin, to purchase marginable securities without adding money to your account. The balance includes open order commitments, intraday trade executions, and money movement into and out of the account.IntradayNon-margin buying power (options, mutual funds, penny stocks)Margin buying power available to purchase securities that are not marginable (have a 100% margin requirement)IntradayCommitted to open ordersThe dollar amount allocated to pending orders that have not yet been executed (for example, buy orders and short sale orders). The amount you have committed to open orders decreases your buying power. For margin accounts, this field reflects the impact that an order has on margin buying power for fully marginable securities, even if the open order itself is not for a fully marginable security.IntradayAvailable to trade without margin impactThe maximum dollar amount available to purchase a security without creating a margin debit in your account. This balance includes open order commitments, intraday trade executions, and money movement into and out of your account. Note: This balance is provided in order to help you reduce the likelihood of incurring a margin debit balance on your account. However, it is still possible to be charged margin interest when using this balance due to varying security settlement and mark to market dates.IntradayAvailable to withdrawCash only (core + other money markets)Amount collected and available for immediate withdrawal. This balance includes both core and other Fidelity money market funds held in the account. This balance does not include deposits that have not cleared. Proceeds from sell orders are reflected in this balance on settlement date.IntradayCash and borrowing on marginTotal amount collected and available for immediate withdrawal. This balance includes both core and other Fidelity money market funds held in the account as well as the amount available to borrow generated from securities held in margin. This balance does not include deposits that have not cleared. Proceeds from sell orders are reflected in this balance on settlement date. Withdrawals that exceed the cash in the account by using loan value generated from positions held in margin will increase the margin debit balance in the account.IntradayAdditional balancesMargin equityThe value of all securities held in margin, minus the amount of in-the-money covered options and margin debt (if any) in the accountReal-timeHouse surplus/callA house surplus is the amount of margin equity in the account above the Fidelity minimum requirement (which ranges from 30% to 100%). If the margin equity in the account falls below Fidelity’s minimum requirement, this value will be reflected as a house call. Generally, house calls must be met within five business days, but Fidelity may cover the call at any time.Real-timeExchange surplus/callAn exchange surplus (also known as NYSE surplus) is the amount of margin equity in the account above the NYSE minimum requirement (currently 25%). If the margin equity in the account falls below 25%, this value will be reflected as an exchange call. Generally, exchange calls must be met within 48 hours, but Fidelity may cover the call at any time.Real-timeSMA/Fed callSpecial Memorandum Account/Federal call: When the margin equity in the account exceeds the federal “Reg T” requirement of 50%, the amount in excess of the requirement is referred to as the SMA. If the Reg T initial requirement is not met, a Fed call is issued against the account. Generally, Fed calls must be met within five business days, but Fidelity may cover the call at any time.IntradayAdditional buying powerDay trade buying power (start of day)/minimum equity callThis balance field only applies to pattern day trade accounts. It represents a start-of-day value and does not update during the course of the trading day to reflect trade executions or money movement. A pattern day trade account is required to maintain minimum margin equity of $25,000. If the margin equity falls below this value, this field name will change to “minimum equity call” and the value indicated is what is due to meet the minimum equity requirement.OvernightCash available to tradeThe amount available to purchase securities in a cash account without adding money to the account. An executed buy order will reduce this value, and an executed sell order will increase this value at the time the order executes.IntradaySettled cashThe portion of your cash (core) balance that represents the amount you can buy and sell of a security in a cash account without creating a good faith violation. This amount includes proceeds from transactions settling today, minus unsettled buy transactions, short equity proceeds settling today and the intraday exercisable value of options positions. Additionally, uncollected deposits may not be reflected in this balance until the deposit has gone through the bank collection process which is usually four business days.IntradayCorporate bondsMargin buying power available to purchase corporate bonds. Most corporate bonds are marginable, but margin requirements may vary based on the type of bond.IntradayMunicipal bondsMargin buying power available to purchase municipal bondsIntradayGovernment bondsMargin buying power available to purchase government bondsIntradayDay trade callA day trade call is generated whenever an executed day trade exceeds the account’s day trade buying power. Customers have five business days to meet the call.OvernightAdditional options balancesOptions in-the-moneyOptions that have intrinsic value. A call option is considered “in-the-money” if the price of the underlying security is higher than the strike price of the call. A put option is considered “in-the-money” if the price of the security is lower than the strike price.Real-timeOptions requirementsMargin requirements for single or multi-leg option positions. Your positions, whenever possible, will be paired or grouped as strategies, which can reduce your margin requirements.IntradayCash covered put reserveThe value required to cover short put options contracts held in a cash account. Cash covered put reserve is equal to the options strike price multiplied by the number of contracts purchased, multiplied by the number of shares per contract (usually 100). Cash available to buy securities, cash available to withdraw, and available to withdraw values will be reduced by this value.IntradayCash spread reserveThe requirement for spread positions held in a retirement account. For debit spreads, the requirement is full payment of the debit. For credit spreads, it’s the difference between the strike prices or maximum loss. A $2,000 minimum equity deposit is required in addition to the debit requirement, but can be counted toward the credit requirement.OvernightOptions balances appear if options agreement exists. Day trade balances appear on pattern day trade accounts.Update frequency explained:Real-time: Balances display values that change with market price fluctuations on the underlying securities in your account. Essentially, it is a complete recalculation based on price fluctuations of positions, trade executions, and money movement into or out of the account.Intraday: Balances reflect trade executions and money movement into and out of the account during the day.Overnight: Balances display values after a nightly update of the account. In some cases, certain balance fields can only be updated overnight due to regulatory restrictions.",

  "What is a cash account?": "A cash account is defined as a brokerage account that does not allow for any extension of credit on securities. This includes retirement accounts and other non-retirement accounts that have not been approved for margin. While customers may purchase and sell securities with a cash account, trades are only accepted on the basis of receiving full payment in cash for purchases and good delivery of securities for sales by the trade settlement date.If a cash account customer is approved for options trading, the customer may also purchase options, write covered calls, and cash covered puts.Short selling, uncovered option writing, option spreads, and pattern day-trading strategies all require extension of credit under the terms of a margin account and such transactions are not permitted in a cash account.",
  "What are the rules surrounding cash account trade settlements?": "Rules for payment of securities transactions executed in accounts are established under Federal Reserve Board Regulation T. Under these guidelines, purchases in cash accounts can be accepted under the following conditions: if there are sufficient funds in the account to fully pay for the purchase at the time the trade is executed or the customer makes a good faith agreement to promptly make full payment for the purchase on or before the settlement date and before selling the security.Settlement date may vary by security type and conditions of the trade but is generally three business days for equities and one business day for options and most mutual funds. Fixed income security settlement will vary based on security type and new issue versus secondary market trading.It is important to note that the definition of sufficient funds in a cash account does not include cash account proceeds from the sale of a security that has not settled. It also does not include non-core account money market positions.",
  "What are possible cash account violations?": "A good faith violation occurs when a security purchased in a customer's cash account is sold before being paid for with the settled funds in the account. This is referred to as a \"good faith violation\" because while trade activity gives the appearance that sales proceeds will be used to cover purchases (where sufficient settled cash to cover these purchases is not already in the account), the fact is the position has been liquidated before it was ever paid for with settled funds, and a good faith effort to deposit additional cash into the account will not happen.Good faith violation example 1:Cash available to trade = $0.00On Monday morning, a customer sells XYZ stock netting $10,000 in cash account proceeds.On Monday afternoon, the customer buys ABC stock for $10,000.If the customer sells ABC stock prior to Thursday (the settlement date of the XYZ sale), the transaction would be deemed to be a good faith violation because ABC stock was sold before the account had sufficient funds to fully pay for the purchase.Good faith violation example 2:Cash available to trade = $10,000, all of which is settledOn Monday morning, the customer purchases $10,000 of XYZ stock.On Monday mid-day, the customer sells the XYZ stock for $10,500.At this point, no good faith violation has occurred because the customer had sufficient funds (i.e. settled cash) for the purchase of XYZ stock at the time the purchase was made.Near market close, the customer purchases $10,500 of ABC stock.A good faith violation will occur if the customer sells the ABC stock prior to Thursday when Monday's sale of XYZ stock settles and the proceeds of that sale are available to fully pay for the purchase of ABC stock.Good faith violation example 3:Cash available to trade = $15,000, of which $5,000 is from an unsettled sell order from Friday that is due to settle on Wednesday.On Monday morning, the customer purchases $15,000 of ABC stock.The purchase is not considered fully paid for because the $5,000 in proceeds from the sale of stock from the previous Friday will not settle until Wednesday.A good faith violation will occur if the customer sells the ABC stock prior to Wednesday.A cash liquidation violation occurs when a customer purchases securities and the cost of those securities is covered after the purchase date by the sale of other fully paid securities in the cash account.Cash liquidation violation example 1:Cash available to trade = $0.00On Monday, the customer purchases $10,000 of ABC stock.On Tuesday, the customer sells XYZ stock, which had been purchased the previous month, for $12,500 in proceeds (due to settle on Friday).A cash liquidation violation has occurred because the customer purchased ABC stock by selling other securities after the purchase. When the ABC transaction settles on Thursday, the customer's cash account will not have the sufficient settled cash to fund the purchase because the sale of the XYZ stock will not settle until Friday.A free riding violation occurs when a customer purchases securities and then pays for the cost of those securities by selling the very same securities.Free riding example 1:Cash available to trade = $0.00On Monday morning, the customer places an order to purchase $10,000 of ABC stock through a representative on a good faith agreement of prompt payment by settlement date (Thursday).No payment is received by settlement on Thursday.On Friday, the customer sells ABC stock for $10,500A free riding violation has occurred because no payment was received for the purchase.Free riding example 2:Cash available to trade = $5,000On Monday morning the customer places an order to purchase $10,000 of ABC stock intending to send $5,000 payment later in the week (before Thursday) through an electronic funds transfer.On Tuesday, ABC stock rises dramatically in value due to rumors of a takeover.On Wednesday morning, the customer sells ABC stock for $15,000 and decides it is no longer necessary to send the $5,000 payment.On Thursday, the customer does not complete the electronic funds transfer.A free riding violation has occurred because the $10,000 purchase of ABC stock was paid for, in part, with the sale of ABC stock since the customer did not deposit into the account the additional $5,000 to cover the purchase price of ABC stock by settlement date.A cash account with three good faith violations, three cash liquidation violations or one free riding violation in a 12-month period will be restricted to purchasing securities only when the customer has sufficient settled cash in the cash account at the time of purchase. This restriction is effective for 90 calendar days.",

  "What is my balance for cash available to trade?": "Cash available to trade is defined as the cash dollar amount available for trading in the core account without adding money to the account. This balance includes intraday transaction activity.For unrestricted cash accounts, all buy trades are debited and all sell trades are credited from the cash available to trade balance as soon as the trade executes, not when the trade settles. For example, if the core is $10,000, a deposit of $10,000 is received today, and the account has a $10,000 credit balance from unsettled activity, the cash available to trade balance would be $30,000.For cash accounts restricted for free riding or good faith violations, the cash available to trade balance will not include unsettled cash account sale proceeds.",
  "What is day trading?": "Day trading is defined as buying and selling the same security (or executing a short sale and then buying the same security) during the same business day in a margin account. “Pattern day traders,” as defined by FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) rules, must adhere to specific guidelines for minimum equity and meeting day trade margin calls.",
  "What is a pattern day trader?": "The term \"pattern day trader\" generally means any customer who:Executes four or more day trades within a five-business-day period, orIncurs two unmet day trade calls within a 90-day period.A non-pattern day trader account, or an account with only occasional day trading, becomes designated a pattern day trader if it meets either of the above criteria. To remove the pattern day trader status on an account, the account must not have any day trades for 60 consecutive days.Minimum equity requirements for pattern day tradersPattern day traders must maintain a minimum equity of $25,000 in their margin account at all times or the account will be issued a day trade minimum equity call. Non-marginable securities such as mutual funds that haven't been held for 30 days and options are not counted toward margin equity.For day traders not classified as pattern day traders, the requirement is the minimum margin equity of $2,000 required by all Fidelity brokerage accounts.Day trade minimum equity callA day trade minimum equity call occurs when the margin account equity in a pattern day trader account falls below $25,000. This minimum must be restored within five business days with a deposit of cash or marginable securities. If the day trade minimum equity call is not met, then the account's day trading buying power will be restricted for 90 days. Note that there is a two-business-day holding period on funds deposited to meet a day trade minimum equity call or a day trade call.Day trade buying powerDay trade buying power is the amount that a customer can day trade without incurring a day trade call.The rules generally permit a pattern day trader to trade up to four times the minimum margin excess (also referred to as \"exchange surplus\") in the account using time and tick and as of the close of business of the previous day. Time and tick calculates margin using each trade in the sequence that it is executed, using the highest open position during the day. This information is only available to eligible day traders on Fidelity.com or Active Trader Pro®.Note: Money market and cash credit balances are not included in the calculation of exchange surplus and, consequently, do not factor into day trade buying power.Example:Your account has $20,000 more than the minimum equity requirement for the marginable equities you hold. As a result, your day trade buying power is $80,000 (four times the exchange surplus).If you bought $80,000 of XYZ Corp. at 9:31 a.m. and bought $70,000 of JGG Ind. at 10:00 a.m., then subsequently sold XYZ and JGG, a day trade margin call would be issued the next business day. (One way to avoid the margin call in this example would be to sell XYZ Corp. before purchasing JGG Ind.).The account's day trade buying power balance has a different purpose than the account's buying power value. If you are intending to day trade, then the day's limits are prescribed in the day trade buying power field. If you do not plan to trade in and out of the same security, in the same day, then use the buying power field to track the relevant value.",

Customers have five business days to meet a call in an unrestricted account by depositing cash or marginable securities in the account.The sale of an existing position may satisfy a day trade call but is considered a day trade liquidation. Three day trade liquidations within a 12-month period will cause the account to be restricted. If funds are deposited to meet a day trade call, there is a minimum two-day hold period on those funds in order to consider the call met. Adding additional days for money movement times may be necessary.Any distributions or checks written out of the account during the open day trade call period will increase the call dollar for dollar.

It lets you separate your spending activity from your investment activity.",
  "What spending and money movement features are included with the Fidelity® Cash Management Account?": "Cash Manager is an optional feature that provides you with flexibility in managing your finances by automatically moving cash to your Fidelity® Cash Management Account when needed and alerting you when your balance falls above or below “target” levels.

  "How do I open a Fidelity® Cash Management Account?": "The easiest way to open a Fidelity® Cash Management Account is to enroll online. Visit Open an Account to enroll online or to download and print an application. Accounts with trust registrations must be opened using a paper application.",
  "How does the FDIC insurance coverage work?": "The cash balance in the Fidelity® Cash Management Account is swept into an FDIC-insured interest-bearing account at one or more program banks. The deposit at the banks is eligible for FDIC insurance and subject to FDIC insurance coverage limits. Fidelity automatically performs all transfers between the program banks and your account. You cannot access your funds directly from a program bank. Please refer to the following for additional information:Fidelity® Cash Management Account FDIC-Insured Deposit Sweep Program Disclosure document (PDF) for complete explanation and disclosures on the Deposit Sweep ProgramList of Program Bankswww.fdic.gov for additional information on FDIC insurance coverage limits",
  "How does the FDIC Deposit Sweep Program help maximize my FDIC insurance eligibility?": "The FDIC Deposit Sweep Program maximizes your FDIC eligibility by systematically allocating your cash across multiple program banks. For example, a deposit of $500,000 to an individually registered Fidelity® Cash Management Account will be spread across three program banks. $245,000 will be swept to the first two program banks each and $10,000 is swept into a third program bank. Sweeping only $245,000 rather than the respective FDIC coverage limit of $250,000 helps to ensure that any accrued (unpaid) interest is also protected by FDIC Deposit Insurance Coverage. Under this example, a subsequent deposit of an additional $50,000 will be automatically swept into the third program bank.",
  "Who is responsible for monitoring my account to make sure it does not exceed FDIC coverage limits?": "You are responsible for monitoring the total amount of cash on deposit with the program banks assigned to your Fidelity® Cash Management Account. Note this total includes other FDIC eligible assets at Fidelity as well as at other financial institutions held in the same right and legal capacity. Fidelity offers email alerts to customers with accounts that have the FDIC-Insured Deposit Sweep Program when the core program bank balance exceeds the FDIC limits ($250,000 for individual accounts, and $500,000 for joint accounts). You can view the amount of cash at each program bank via Fidelity.com at all times.",
  "What if my balance at an assigned bank exceeds the FDIC insurance coverage limits?": "If you exceed the FDIC coverage limits at a bank assigned to hold your deposits, contact us at 800-931-9987 to discuss opting out of a bank or updating the program bank list assigned to your account.Remember, the FDIC limit applies to all accounts you hold at a bank, so be sure that you consider balances in other accounts you have directly with the bank.",
  "How does the FDIC insurance coverage work if I hold investments in my Fidelity Cash Management Account?": "Securities held in a brokerage account are not eligible for FDIC-insurance coverage. Instead, brokerage accounts maintained with Fidelity, including the Fidelity® Cash Management Account, are protected by Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which protects brokerage accounts of each customer when a brokerage firm is closed due to bankruptcy or other financial difficulties and customer assets are missing from accounts. SIPC protects brokerage accounts of each customer up to $500,000 in securities, including a limit of $250,000 on claims for cash. Money market funds held in a brokerage account are considered securities. For more information on SIPC coverage, please review the brochure “How SIPC Protects You” available for free download at www.sipc.org.Also see How Fidelity Safeguards Your Accounts for additional information.",
  "Can I designate a Fidelity® Cash Management Account as a checking account in Quicken®?": "Quicken® recognizes a Fidelity® Cash Management Account as a checking account when you follow these steps:From the Main Menu in Quicken, choose Tools > Accounts List.Select the investment account to which you’d like to add a linked checking account, then click the Edit button.On the General Information tab on the Account Details window, choose “yes” to “Show cash in a checking account.” Quicken will prompt you to back up your data file.Once the backup is complete, the linked checking account is created in Quicken with the same name as your investment account, plus the suffix “Cash.” Click the OK button to save your changes.",
  "Why should I set up Cash Manager?": "By setting up Cash Manager, you can automatically move cash to your Fidelity® Cash Management Account when you need it and receive alerts so that you can actively invest extra cash when you have it.Here's how Cash Manager works:You open a Fidelity® Cash Management Account and set a maximum target balance, a minimum target balance, a minimum transfer amount, and a hierarchy of funding accounts to supply available cash to your Fidelity® Cash Management Account.When the cash in your Fidelity® Cash Management Account hits your maximum target balance, Cash Manager alerts you so you can move the money and invest it for the long run.If the cash in your Fidelity® Cash Management Account drops below your minimum target balance, Cash Manager moves available cash automatically from your designated funding accounts in the order you specified.Sign up for Cash Manager overdraft protection, and if your debit requests (e.g., checks, debit card, direct debit) exceed the balance in your Fidelity® Cash Management Account, available funds from your funding accounts (up to $99,999.99 per day per funding account) will automatically be moved to your Fidelity® Cash Management Account to cover the debit. Available funds include cash (core), available margin, and non-core money market funds. These sources will be drawn from the first funding account in this order before the next account is tapped.",
  "What is the difference between Cash Manager self-funded overdraft protection and a minimum target balance?": "Self-funded overdraft protection provides available cash immediately for pending transactions if your balance would otherwise go below $0 (into overdraft). It can provide emergency protection and will draw only enough cash to prevent a negative account balance by drawing on available cash, available margin, and non-core money market funds in your designated Fidelity funding accounts (up to $99,999.99 per day per funding account).Minimum target balance is used to automatically transfer available cash on a nightly basis to restore the cash balance minimum you have set for your Fidelity® Cash Management Account. It is triggered by your available cash balance only (not transactions) and will draw your minimum transfer amount ($250 minimum) of cash from your designated funding accounts (up to $99,999.99 per day per funding account) in the order you have set.",
  "How does Cash Manager's free self-funded overdraft protection differ from the overdraft protection I get at my bank?": "Cash Manager's self-funded overdraft protection differs from the overdraft protection available at a typical bank in two ways:TimingWith Cash Manager, overdraft protection is provided by moving funds from your funding accounts (up to $99,999.99 per day per funding account) so quickly that no overdraft actually occurs. With a bank, typically overdraft protection is provided by tapping into a line of credit once an overdraft occurs.Interest ChargesTo provide overdraft protection, Cash Manager moves available cash from the first of your Fidelity funding accounts (up to $99,999.99 per day per funding account) before it draws on available margin debt—if it needs to draw on margin debt at all. Margin is only tapped if you have elected it on your funding accounts. With Cash Manager's overdraft protection, you incur no interest charge if no margin debt is drawn, and if margin debt is drawn, you can reduce interest charges by replenishing your Fidelity funding accounts. Typically, with a bank, overdraft protection incurs an interest charge as soon as it is used, and you are charged interest until you pay off the debt.",
  "Will any stocks, bonds, or mutual funds be sold if I drop below my minimum balance or use Cash Manager overdraft protection?": "No, Cash Manager only moves available cash once per day as follows: every night, Fidelity checks the cash balance in your Fidelity® Cash Management Account. If that balance is below your minimum target balance, Cash Manager moves enough available cash from your funding accounts (up to $99,999.99 per day per funding account) to your Fidelity® Cash Management Account to restore its cash balance to the minimum target balance. If there is not enough cash in the first funding account in your hierarchy, Cash Manager checks the second funding account in your hierarchy for available funds. It continues until the Fidelity® Cash Management Account cash balance is restored, or there are no more accounts in your funding account hierarchy. Cash Manager will always attempt to move the minimum transfer amount or the difference between the actual cash balance and the minimum target balance—whichever is larger. To restore the minimum target balance, Cash Manager will only move cash that is available in your funding accounts. It does not use available margin or non-core money market funds. They are only used to cover overdrafts if you select that option. Cash Manager overdraft protection is funded by using available funds (available cash, available margin, and non-core Fidelity money market assets) from a hierarchy of Fidelity funding accounts (up to $99,999.99 per day per funding account) that you designate. It will not sell equity or bond positions or non-money market funds, and will not subject you to variations in market conditions. Fidelity funding accounts are tapped in the order you specified in your funding account hierarchy. If there are not enough funds in all of your Fidelity funding accounts to cover a debit request, no money will be transferred, and the debit will be referred to the Fidelity Margin Department for a payment decision. Debit card transactions are always rejected if there are not enough funds, because there is not enough time for the Margin Department to research other possible available funds.",
  "What types of accounts are eligible to be Cash Manager funding accounts?": "Cash Manager funding accounts must be owned fully by the owners of the Fidelity® Cash Management Account they are funding. Eligible accounts include:Individual (I) or Joint (J) registrations, including Transfer on Death (TOD) equivalents.Trust Under Agreement (TRUA)A bank account you have previously connected to the Fidelity® Cash Management Account by electronic funds transfer (EFT). (Note that the bank account will only be used to restore the minimum target balance and not be used for overdraft protection.)If you want a funding account to have the automatic investment (AI) account feature, you must establish AI on the account BEFORE linking it to the Fidelity® Cash Management Account via Cash Manager. If an account is already linked as a funding account, and you want to add AI, you must first de-link the account, add in the AI, and then re-link the account to the Fidelity® Cash Management Account via Cash Manager.The Personal Withdrawal Service (PWS) can be set up on a funding account without de-linking it first.The same funding account cannot be used to concurrently fund two different Fidelity® Cash Management Accounts using Cash Manager.Stock Plan Services (SPS) accounts are not eligible to be funding accounts. You can request manual transfers between an SPS account and a Fidelity® Cash Management Account.If the Fidelity® Cash Management Account is an individual registration in, for example, John’s name, only accounts owned by John can be funding accounts. If the Fidelity® Cash Management Account is a joint registration owned by John and Jane, then funding accounts could be John’s and/or Jane’s accounts and Joint accounts owned only by both John and Jane. Note that only John can set up his individual registered account and only Jane can set up her individual registered account as funding accounts.Note that trustees on a TRUA account are considered owners of the account and Fidelity uses the TIN or SSN to recognize the identity of the owners. So if the TRUA account uses a TIN and the individual account uses a SSN, Fidelity will not know that the owners are the same person even if they identify the same person.Any trustee registered on a trust Fidelity® Cash Management Account has access to Cash Manager and may set it up or modify it on behalf of all the trustees. Approval of all trustees for setting up or modifying Cash Manager is not required. This means that any trustee can set the minimum and maximum balance levels for the trust Fidelity® Cash Management Account or designate funding accounts. However, funding accounts must be owned in their entirety by the trustees of the Fidelity® Cash Management Account that they are funding. In other words, all owners and/or trustees on a funding account must be listed as registered trustees on the trust Fidelity® Cash Management Account.For example, if the trustees on a Fidelity® Cash Management Account are John and Jane, then the following accounts are eligible as funding accounts:John’s individual accountJane’s individual accountJohn and Jane’s joint accountTrust account for which John is the sole trusteeTrust account for which Jane is the sole trusteeTrust account for which both John and Jane are the only trusteesIf there is a trust account for which John, Jane, and Mary are the trustees, then this account would not be eligible as a funding account because Mary is not registered on the Fidelity® Cash Management Account.Conversely, if Mary is a trustee on the Fidelity® Cash Management Account, all the accounts above are still eligible as a funding account because John and Jane are listed on the trust Fidelity® Cash Management Account. The rule that all owners and/or trustees on a funding account must be listed as registered trustees on the trust Fidelity® Cash Management Account is satisfied.",
  "When I link my individual account to a joint account, will the joint owners be able to see my funding account balance?": "Yes, when you link an account, we automatically activate \"view only\" access to allow all joint account owners to see shared account information. However, this allows them to view the funding account’s balance as well. Currently, there's no way to limit this access but we are working to improve this feature.",
  "Why can I not draw from my bank to provide self-funded overdraft protection?": "Fidelity uses electronic funds transfer (EFT) to move money from your bank. It takes several days for the funds on an EFT to settle into your Fidelity® Cash Management Account. Because of this delay, Fidelity can only use EFT from your bank to restore your account to the minimum target balance. Note that Cash Manager will not send multiple requests to your bank until the first one is fully processed.",
  "Do I need to have more than one funding account?": "No, only one funding account is needed to set up Cash Manager. However, if that one funding account is a bank account, no overdraft protection can be provided.",
  "When will I be alerted about money movement for Fidelity® Cash Management Account?": "An alert is sent after a transaction is initiated. Your latest alerts are always available on your Fidelity® Cash Management Account overview page. If you choose to have your alerts sent to you by wireless communication, the amount of time that elapses after the transaction is initiated and you receive your alert depends on the device on which you receive your alert, and the service you have on that device.",
  "Can I suspend or remove the Cash Manager feature from my Fidelity® Cash Management Account?": "Yes, you can temporarily suspend or permanently remove the Cash Manager feature at any time. If you permanently remove Cash Manager, you can reestablish it by setting it up again.Suspending Cash ManagerYou can suspend Cash Manager for up to 10 business days. You may wish to suspend Cash Manager if you are anticipating a transaction in your account that would cause your balance to fall below your minimum target balance and you do not want money moved automatically from your funding accounts. Cash Manager will automatically reactivate after 10 business days or you can reactivate it yourself before 10 business days by visiting the Cash Manager preferences page and selecting the Reactivate option.Removing Cash ManagerYou can remove the Cash Manager feature from your account by clicking Remove on the Cash Manager preferences page. When your Cash Manager status is removed, all your Cash Manager preferences are deleted. You can reestablish Cash Manager on your Fidelity® Cash Management Account by completing the setup process again. Set your Cash Manager status to Remove only when you want to permanently remove Cash Manager from your Fidelity® Cash Management Account.",
  "Can I use my current bank account as a Cash Manager funding account?": "Yes, it is possible to use your current bank account as a last choice funding account to restore the Fidelity® Cash Management Account minimum target balance. You must first create an electronic funds transfer (EFT) link between the Fidelity® Cash Management Account and your bank account.Please note that there could be a prenote waiting period of approximately 7 to 10 calendar days associated with the establishment of this EFT link. Once the EFT prenote period has been completed, and the link has been fully established, it will take up to four business days for an executed EFT transaction to be processed through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network before the cash will be available in the Fidelity® Cash Management Account.",
  "Can the automatic investment (AI) service be a Cash Management Account feature, and used with the Cash Manager feature?": "Yes, the automatic investment (AI) service can be set up on either a Fidelity® Cash Management Account or on a Cash Manager funding account. Please note that the AI service is currently available from an outside account to a Fidelity account.If you want a funding account to have the AI account feature, you must establish AI on the account BEFORE linking it to the Fidelity® Cash Management Account via Cash Manager. If an account is already linked as a funding account, and you want to add AI, you must first de-link the account, add in the AI, and then re-link the account to the Fidelity® Cash Management Account via Cash Manager.Generally, during the overnight processing cycle for money movement associated with a Fidelity account, AI is processed first, followed by personal withdrawal service (PWS) second, and then Cash Manager third. This means that if a Fidelity® Cash Management Account or a Cash Manager funding account has a mix of the above money movement features enabled, available funds will be moved based on the processing priority outlined above. Any money movement transaction which impacts the account’s core cash balance (for example: purchase, wire check redemption, IRA contribution) may affect PWS, AI, or Cash Manager money movement.",
  "Can the personal withdrawal service (PWS) be a Cash Management Account feature, and used with the Cash Manager feature?": "Yes, the personal withdrawal service (PWS) can be set up on either a Fidelity® Cash Management Account or on a Cash Manager funding account.Generally, during the overnight processing cycle for money movement associated with a Fidelity account, automatic investment (AI) is processed first, followed by PWS second, and then Cash Manager third. This means that if a Fidelity® Cash Management Account or a Cash Manager funding account has a mix of the above money movement features enabled; funds will be moved based on the processing priority outlined above. Any money movement transaction which impacts the account's core cash balance (for example: purchase, wire check redemption, IRA contribution) may affect PWS, AI, or Cash Manager money movement.",

  "How does an IRA benefit me?": "Many people are unsure of how much they need to save for retirement, and may fall short of their retirement savings goals. Opening a Fidelity IRA may help you accumulate money you'll need in retirement.1",
  "Should I save in my 401(k) or my IRA?": "At Fidelity, we believe that you should consider contributing the full amount of 401(k) elective deferral contributions required to receive the maximum employer match offered in your workplace retirement plan as your first priority, rather than leaving that money on the table. 401(k) deferrals are an easy way to start early and contribute regularly, with the convenience of payroll deductions.For many savers, the simplicity and discipline of payroll deductions make the logical next step to maximize your 401(k) elective deferrals up to the 402(g) annual deferral limit, $18,000 for 2015 ($23,500 if 50 years or older). You could then open an IRA or another tax-advantaged retirement savings vehicle.",
  "Are there income limits to contribute to an IRA?": "There are no income limits for Traditional IRAs,2 however there are income limits for tax deductible contributions.There are income limits for Roth IRAs. As a single filer, you can make a full contribution to a Roth IRA if your income is less than $114,000 ($114,000 - $129,000 for a partial contribution) in 2014 and $116,000 ($116,000 - $131,000 for a partial contribution) in 2015. If you are married filing jointly, you can make a full contribution to a Roth IRA if your income is less than $181,000 ($181,000 - $191,000 for a partial contribution) in 2014 and $183,000 ($183,000 - $193,000 for a partial contribution) in 2015.",
  "How much can I contribute to my IRA?": "You can contribute up to the lesser of 100% of your earned income or $5,500 for both 2014 and 2015. Once you reach age 50, contribution limits on IRAs increase by another $1,000, allowing those who may have put off starting to save for retirement to “catch up” on their savings by contributing an amount over the standard contribution limit.To see how much you may be able to contribute this year, use the IRA Contribution Calculator.",
  "If I qualify to contribute to both a Traditional IRA and Roth IRA, which one should I save in?": "If you qualify for Roth IRA contributions, you should consider it. Having a mix of both pretax and Roth contributions can help create additional flexibility in retirement to respond to a great unknown—future tax rates. For people who expect income in retirement to be as high or higher than their current level, others who expect their tax rate in retirement to be higher than today, or younger people who expect steady income growth over their careers, Roth IRA contributions may be the better choice. But if you believe that your tax rates will be lower in retirement than they are now, you may want to prioritize pretax vehicles like the Traditional IRA. Our IRA Evaluator allows you to answer a few questions and find out which one might be right for you.",

  "Can I withdraw money from my IRA?": "Under certain conditions, you can withdraw money from your IRA without penalty. The rules vary depending on the type of IRA you have. Generally, for a Traditional IRA, distributions prior to age 59½ are subject to a 10% penalty in addition to federal and state taxes unless an exception applies.5 Starting at age 59½, you can begin taking money out of your IRA without penalty, but you will still be responsible for taxes that might be due.Starting at age 70½, minimum required distributions (MRDs) begin—you can calculate how much you will be required to take using this MRD Calculator. You can also use our Retirement Distribution Center to get estimated MRDs for your Fidelity IRAs (Traditional IRAs, SEP IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, Rollover IRAs, and all small-business retirement plans). Our system also keeps track of all withdrawals and allows you to set up automated distributions. Learn more about our Retirement Distribution Center.For a Roth IRA, you can take a penalty-free, federal tax-free distribution of contributions at any time. Provided you have met the five-year aging requirement, and one of the following conditions, you may also take a tax-free and penalty-free distribution of earnings:Over age 59½Death or disabilityFirst-time home purchaseNote: There are no MRDs for Roth IRAs during the lifetime of the original owner.Please review Withdrawing From Your IRA for more information.",
  "Can I convert my existing Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA?": "Yes, most investors, regardless of their income, can convert eligible retirement savings to a Roth IRA. Please speak with your tax advisor about your specific situation and whether this may make sense for you.",

  "What is a Rollover IRA?": "A Rollover IRA is a Traditional IRA that is often used by those who have changed jobs or retired and have assets accumulated in their employer-sponsored retirement plan, such as a 401(k).Eligible distributions from such plans can be rolled over directly into a Fidelity Rollover IRA without incurring any tax penalties and assets remain invested tax-deferred. Consolidating multiple employer-sponsored retirement plan accounts into a single Rollover IRA can make it easier to allocate and monitor your retirement assets.",
  "What do I need to do to roll over my retirement plan assets to a Fidelity IRA?": "A rollover takes three steps:Open the appropriate IRA.*Move your money to Fidelity—to do this, you will need to initiate a rollover from your former employer’s plan.Choose your investments in the Rollover IRA.Call 800-343-3548 and a rollover specialist will help you every step of the way. They can answer your questions, plus help you initiate the distribution and complete any paperwork that may be required.*Note that if you have an existing IRA at Fidelity, you can roll your assets into that account (see the next question).",
  "Can I roll over assets into my Traditional IRA?": "Yes, you can but it's important to be aware that if you do roll pre-tax 401(k) funds into a traditional IRA, you may not be able to convert those funds back into an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Contact your tax advisor for more information.",
  "Will I owe taxes on my rollover?": "Generally, there are no tax implications if you complete a direct rollover and the assets go directly from your employer-sponsored plan into a Rollover or Traditional IRA via a trustee-to-trustee transfer.However, if you choose to convert some or all of your savings in your employer-sponsored retirement plan directly to a Roth IRA, the conversion would be subject to ordinary income tax. Contact your tax advisor for more information.If you withdraw the assets from your former employer‑sponsored retirement plan, the check is made payable to you, and taxes are withheld, you may still be able to complete a 60-day rollover. Within 60 days of receiving the distribution check, you must deposit the money into a Rollover IRA to avoid current income taxes.If taxes were withheld from the distribution, you would have to replace that amount if you want to roll over your entire distribution to your Fidelity IRA. If you hold the assets for more than 60 days, your distribution will be subject to current income taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are under age 59½.",
  "Can I move an existing IRA from another institution to Fidelity?": "Yes, visit IRA Transfers for a quick overview of the online process.",
  "What should I do if my former employer's 401(k) was recordkept by Fidelity?": "If you would like to roll over a former employer's retirement savings plan that is recordkept by Fidelity, please call a rollover specialist at 800-343-3548 for assistance.",
  "Can I roll my money into a Roth IRA?": "Most people are eligible to convert their 401(k) to a Roth IRA; however, it is important to be aware of the potential tax implications. If you have money in a designated Roth 401(k), you can roll it directly into a Roth IRA without incurring any tax penalties. However, if the 401(k) funds are pre-tax, then converting to a Roth IRA will be a taxable event. Nevertheless, a conversion has the potential to help minimize future taxes and maximize retirement savings. There are several factors to consider when deciding if converting to a Roth IRA may be right for you. Call Fidelity for more information about converting your savings to a Roth IRA.",
  "I already received a check made payable to me, and 20% was withheld. If I roll over my money now, can I get that 20% back?": "You’ll have to replace the 20% that was withheld with your own savings if you want to roll over your entire distribution to your Fidelity IRA—all within 60 days of receiving the distribution. If you do, the 20% that was withheld is credited toward your income tax liability when you file your tax return. However, if you don’t have the cash to make up for the 20% withheld, the IRS will consider that 20% as a distribution, making it subject to taxes and a possible 10% early withdrawal penalty if you are under age 59½.",
  "How do I know if I am eligible for a rollover?": "Generally there must be a distributable event. The most common eligibility event is when an individual leaves the service of their employer. Other reasons may include attainment of age 59½, death, or disability. Please contact your plan to determine whether or not you are eligible for a distribution and, therefore, a rollover.",
  "Can I add more money to my IRA later?": "Yes, you can add money to your IRA with either annual contributions or you can consolidate other former employer-sponsored retirement plan assets or IRAs. Some people choose to make their annual contributions to their IRA so that they only have to keep track of one account. This may be right for you if you have no desire to roll these assets back to a qualified retirement plan at a future employer. Assets can be commingled and still be eligible to roll into another employer plan in the future; however, it is at the discretion of the receiving plan to determine what type of assets can be rolled over.",
  "Can I leave my former employer-sponsored retirement plan assets in my current plan indefinitely?": "No, generally, you must begin to take withdrawals, known as minimum required distributions (MRDs), from all your retirement accounts (excluding Roth IRAs) no later than April 1 of the year following the year in which you turn age 70½.Check with your plan administrator to see if there are any other rules that may require the money to be taken out prior to you turning age 70½. For example, many plans require that accounts smaller than $5,000 be cashed out or rolled over. Learn more about MRDs.",
  "Can I leave a portion of my 401(k) in an old employer's plan and roll the remaining amount to an IRA?": "Plans have different rules and requirements for 401(k) assets. Some 401(k) plans offer equal flexibility to both current and former employees while others place restrictions on withdrawal types and frequency. For example, some plans may allow partial withdrawals while others may require that you either leave all the funds in the plan or perform a full rollover or cash payout. Please check the plan's rules for more information.",
  "Can I roll over my existing 401(k) assets into an IRA while I am still working?": "Generally, you cannot roll over funds from your active 401(k), but there are some exceptions. For example, some plans allow for \"in service\" withdrawals at age 59½. If you are under age 59½, or if your plan does not have that withdrawal provision, you may be able to withdraw (or roll over) specific types of contributions. For example, if in the past you rolled money directly from an old 401(k) into your current plan, you may be able to move that money out of your plan into an IRA.",
  "Can I roll over an old 401(k) that has both pre-tax and after-tax money in it?": "You can, but it is important to select the right IRA for your needs. A Traditional (or Rollover) IRA is typically used for pre-tax assets because savings will stay invested on a tax-deferred basis and you won't owe any taxes on the rollover transaction itself. However, if you roll pre-tax assets into a Roth IRA, you will owe taxes on those funds. For after-tax assets, your options are a little more varied. You can roll the funds into a Roth IRA tax-free. You also have the option of taking the funds in cash or rolling them into an IRA along with your pre-tax savings. If you choose the latter option, it is important that you keep track of the after-tax amount so that when you start taking distributions, you'll know which funds have already been taxed. IRS Form 8606 is designed to help you do just this. However, before making a decision, please consult with a tax advisor about your specific situation.",
  "If I leave my current employer, can my vested participation in a defined benefit plan be rolled into an IRA?": "The answer depends on the rules of your defined benefit plan, and the type of defined benefit plan. Defined benefit plans, often called pension plans, are qualified accounts, meaning that they contain money that has not been taxed as income. Historically, such plans do not allow this type of transfer until you officially retire, whether or not you were an active employee at the time of retirement. However, as the workforce environment and IRS rules have changed over time, many pension plans now afford greater flexibility.If your defined benefit plan offers the proper type of distribution, you could roll it over to an IRA or to a new employer's plan, if the plan allows. You should check with your current employer to determine if they will accept a rollover of this type. However, before making a decision, consider that a pension can be a great source of guaranteed income in retirement and should not be dismissed unless you have a specific plan for generating enough income without the pension payments.",
  "What is Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA)?": "Net unrealized appreciation is the difference between the price you initially paid for a stock (its cost basis) and its current market value.",
  "When is a Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA) strategy favorable?": "For retirement plan participants who own employer stock that has grown in value from its original cost, it may be beneficial to adopt an NUA strategy for the employer stock. Generally, from a tax perspective, it is more favorable for participants to roll over their retirement plan assets to an IRA or new employer-sponsored plan rather than take a lump-sum distribution. However, for participants who have large amounts of appreciated company stock, it may be more beneficial to take a lump-sum distribution of company stock instead because it allows them to pay taxes now at a lower rate. Consult your tax advisor for more information.Hypothetical examples:An individual owns 1,000 shares of company stock with a current fair market value of $200,000.An individual paid $40 per share for a cost basis of $40,000.An individual's Net Unrealized Appreciation is $160,000 ($200,000 – $40,000).If an individual adopts an NUA strategy and takes a lump-sum distribution of the employer stock, he will owe income tax on the $40,000. Assuming the participant is over age 59½ and in the third highest federal income tax bracket (28%), his or her federal income tax liability would be $11,200 (28% times $40,000) in the year the stock is distributed in-kind from the plan. If he or she were to immediately liquidate the shares, and assuming there were no further increases or decreases in share value, then federal income taxes owed on the NUA would be $24,000 ($160,000 x 15%). There would be no 10% penalty on this NUA, regardless of the participant's age.If the individual elected to liquidate the stock in the plan and take a cash distribution, or roll that stock over to a Rollover IRA and then withdraw the entire balance in cash, the entire market value of the stock would be taxed at the federal level at the ordinary income tax rate. In this example, we're assuming a 28% federal ordinary income tax rate on $200,000, for a hefty bill of $56,000. (Keep in mind that those taxes could go higher depending on your federal income tax bracket and any applicable early withdrawal penalties.)NUA guidelinesIn order to qualify for NUA, you must meet all of the criteria listed below:You must distribute your entire vested balance in your plan within one tax year (though you don't have to take all distributions at the same time).You must distribute all assets from all qualified plans you hold with the employer, even if only one holds company stock.You must take the distribution of company stock as actual shares. You may not convert them to cash before the distribution. Not all companies allow in‑kind distributions, so be sure to check whether it's an option in your plan.You must experience one of the following:Separation from service from the company whose plan holds the stock (except in the case of self-employed workers)Reaching age 59½Total disability (for self-employed workers only)DeathOf course, there are a number of other factors to consider before deciding to use NUA treatment, such as your overall capital gains situation, your estate plan, and charitable giving, before taking any course of action. A tax professional and financial advisor can help you determine whether the NUA rule applies to your individual circumstances, and if so, how best to deploy it.Note: The current tax rate is used in this example and is subject to change.",
  "How is a Roth IRA different from a Traditional IRA?": "With a Roth IRA, you contribute money that's already been taxed (that is, “after-tax” dollars). Any earnings in a Roth IRA have the potential to grow tax-free as long as they stay in the account. Withdrawals of earnings from Roth IRAs are federal income tax-free and penalty-free if a five-year aging period has been met and the account owner is age 59½ or over, disabled, or deceased. Roth IRAs are not subject to minimum required distribution (MRD) rules during the lifetime of the original owner, so you can leave your assets in the Roth IRA where they have the potential to continue to grow.With a Traditional IRA, contributions can be made on an after-tax basis, or a pre-tax (tax-deductible) basis if certain requirements are met. Any earnings in the Traditional IRA are tax-deferred as long as they remain in the account. Withdrawals of pre-tax monies are subject to ordinary income tax when withdrawn. Beginning the year in which you turn age 70½, MRDs are required from Traditional IRAs.For both types of IRAs, distributions before age 59½ may be subject to both ordinary income taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty. For a detailed comparison, view the Traditional vs. Roth comparison table.",
  "Should I consider converting to a Roth IRA?": "For many individuals, converting to a Roth IRA may make sense. However, you should consult with a tax advisor and consider the following four factors prior to making your decision:Taxes: With a conversion, you pay federal income taxes now on the conversion amount, but none on any future earnings as long as when withdrawals are taken, the five-year aging period has been met and you are age 59½ or over, disabled, or deceased.If you think your tax rate will be higher in retirement than it is today, you may want to consider a Roth IRA conversion. If your taxable income is lower this year than in a typical year, or if you have accounts that have lost value, you may want to consider a Roth IRA conversion because you may pay less in taxes. If you plan to leave your assets to your beneficiaries, consider conversion because they may not have to pay federal taxes on that money.Time: The relative benefits of conversion will generally increase the longer your money remains in the Roth IRA. Generally, conversion may not make sense if your time horizon is less than five years, because if you have not met the five-year aging requirement, any withdrawals are subject to a 10% penalty.Cost: Because you will be required to pay federal income taxes on the conversion now, you need to consider that cost and whether or not you can afford that this year.MRDs: There are no minimum required distributions (MRDs) from a Roth IRA during the lifetime of the original owner. If you think your tax rate will be the same or higher than your current rate when you withdraw your money, it may make sense to consider converting to a Roth IRA now.",
  "What if I am over 70 1/2 and need to take a minimum required distribution (MRD)?": "You cannot convert a minimum required distribution to a Roth IRA. Converting to a Roth IRA will not satisfy your MRD. You will need to take your MRD before you convert.",
  "How much should I consider converting?": "Since a Roth conversion is a taxable event (in other words, you will have to pay taxes on the amount of money you are converting), when determining how much to convert, you may want to consider how much money you have set aside in nonretirement sources to pay the resulting taxes. You may also want to consider converting to a Roth IRA over a number of years (tax periods) in amounts that will keep the income from the conversion within your current federal tax bracket, or within a federal tax bracket you are comfortable with.",
  "How should I plan to pay for taxes resulting from converting to a Roth IRA?": "To help maximize your retirement savings, it’s generally a good idea to consider not using the proceeds from the conversion to pay the resulting tax costs. Instead, you should consider using cash or other savings held in nonretirement accounts. Using retirement account funds to pay the taxes will reduce the amount you would have available to potentially grow tax-free in your new Roth IRA. Additionally, if you are under 59½, using funds from your retirement account could result in an additional 10% tax penalty, which may significantly reduce the potential benefit of conversion.",
  "What can I convert or roll over to a Roth IRA?": "You may be able to convert the following account types to a Roth IRA:Traditional IRARollover IRASEP IRASIMPLE IRASARSEP IRAOld 401(k)Old 403(b)Old governmental 457(b)",
  "Can I roll over assets from my workplace retirement account at a former employer directly to a Roth IRA?": "Yes, you can choose to convert an eligible rollover distribution from your old 401(k) directly to a Roth IRA. You will owe taxes on the amount of pretax assets you roll over. Note: If you have assets in a Designated Roth Account (i.e., Roth 401(k)) and would like to roll these to an IRA, you can only do so to a Roth IRA.",
  "Am I eligible to convert?": "The income limit(s) were removed in 2010. However, income limits on Roth IRA annual contributions will still apply. A provision in the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 (TIPRA) allows more people to convert to Roth IRAs by removing the modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) limitations on conversions from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.",
  "What are the potential tax implications of converting?": "You'll owe taxes on the previously untaxed amount of your IRA that's converted. But, unlike Traditional IRA withdrawals before age 59½, there's no penalty involved.There are a number of factors to consider to help you decide how much to convert. Consider these questions:Do you have the money set aside in a nonretirement account to pay the tax?How much can you convert without moving into a higher tax bracket?It’s generally considered a good idea to use cash from a nonretirement savings or brokerage account to pay the taxes, instead of using the proceeds from the conversion.Using funds from the retirement account you are converting will reduce the amount of money you will have in your Roth IRA. Doing so could generate even more tax liability and reduce the additional advantage of potential tax-free growth on the full amount of the conversion.If you are under 59½, using funds from the retirement account you are converting may result in an additional 10% tax penalty that may significantly reduce the potential benefit from the conversion.",
  "Can I change my mind?": "You may have the ability to recharacterize (revert) your Roth IRA back into a Traditional IRA. Some reasons for considering a recharacterization include:Your Roth IRA investments decreased in value since you converted.Your taxable income is higher than you expected.The additional taxable income that is the result of converting a Traditional IRA into a Roth IRA puts you into a higher federal tax bracket.You won't have enough cash to cover the tax bill.You should consult a tax advisor to more fully understand the regulations surrounding recharacterization and conversions.Reverse a previous Roth IRA conversionLog In Required",
  "Are there any limitations on going back to a Roth IRA after I recharacterize?": "If you converted an amount from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA and subsequently recharacterized that amount back to a Traditional IRA, that amount cannot be reconverted back to a Roth IRA before either the beginning of the calendar year following the calendar year of the conversion, or the end of the 30-day period beginning on the day of the recharacterization, whichever is later. Consult your tax advisor regarding your eligibility to complete a reconversion.",
  "How do I convert to a Roth IRA?": "Deciding whether to convert to a Roth IRA is not a simple decision. Before you begin the process, there are things you can do to prepare:Create a retirement plan, or review the one you have.Consider consolidating your accounts to simplify your finances and make it easier to manage your investments.Determine how you plan to pay the taxes created by your conversion.Use the Roth Conversion Evaluator to help with your decision.",
  "Who can convert to a Roth IRA?": "Since 2010, most investors have been eligible to convert to a Roth IRA regardless of income or marital status.",
  "What account types can you convert?": "Traditional IRAs (including Rollover IRAs), SEP IRAs, SARSEP IRAs, and SIMPLE IRAs are all eligible to be converted to a Roth IRA (SIMPLE IRA contributions cannot be converted to a Roth IRA during the first two years). Rollover IRAs containing assets from an employer-sponsored plan account are also eligible to be converted. In addition, balances from employer-sponsored savings plans (e.g., a 401(k) or 403(b) plan) that are eligible for distribution and rollover may generally be converted (for example, when you are no longer working for the company sponsoring the plan). Consult your own tax advisor.",
  "What are minimum required distributions (MRDs)?": "Minimum required distributions, or MRDs, are mandatory, minimum yearly withdrawals that generally must be taken starting in the year you turn 70½. While there is a minimum amount you are required to withdraw in order to avoid severe penalties, you can always take more than the MRD amount.You generally have to take MRDs from any retirement account in which you contributed tax-deferred assets or had tax-deferred earnings. These accounts include:Traditional IRAsRollover IRAsSIMPLE IRAsSEP IRAsMost Keogh accountsMost 401(k) and 403(b) plansInherited IRAs have special rules for MRDs and the required distributions are time-sensitive, usually beginning in the year after the year of death of the original owner.

  "Are there any exceptions?": "One exception is Roth IRAs. You are not required to take MRDs from your Roth IRA during your lifetime, and you cannot satisfy your Traditional IRA MRD requirement with a withdrawal from a Roth IRA.Another exception is retirement plan accounts, if you are still working. If you continue to work beyond age 70½, and do not own more than 5% of the business you work for, you may be able to defer taking MRDs from your current employer’s Keogh, 401(k), 403(b), or other employer-sponsored retirement plan until April 1 of the calendar year after the year in which you retire. Please consult your plan administrator to learn more.",
  "How do I calculate my MRD?": "Generally, your MRD is determined by dividing the adjusted market value of your tax-deferred retirement account as of December 31 of the prior year by an applicable life expectancy factor taken from the Uniform Lifetime Table (PDF).Our MRD Calculator can help you determine what to withdraw. We also offer the Retirement Distribution Center which can help you manage your withdrawals. This free service keeps track of how much you've withdrawn to date, allows you to set up automatic withdrawals, and provides estimated MRDs for your Fidelity IRAs (Traditional IRAs, SEP IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, Rollover IRAs, and all small-business retirement plans). Learn more about our Retirement Distribution Center.",
  "What if my spouse is more than 10 years younger?": "If your spouse is more than 10 years younger than you, and if he or she will be the sole primary beneficiary for the entire distribution year, you should use the Joint Life Expectancy Table (PDF) to calculate your MRD. This will result in a smaller MRD than with the Uniform Lifetime Table. You can use the MRD Calculator to do this calculation. If that spouse is listed on your account as the sole beneficiary with the correct date of birth on Fidelity.com, then Fidelity will use that information and your life expectancy factor from the Joint Life Expectancy Table. This information must be correct on Fidelity.com before December 31 for it to be used in the annual recalculation process.",
  "Will Fidelity calculate my MRD for me?": "Yes, to view your MRD estimate for the current year, please visit the Retirement Distribution Center (RDC)Log In Required. You can also find current year estimates and year-to-date withdrawals on your account statement. Prior year estimates, dating back to 2012, are available in the RDC but only for accounts held at Fidelity during that time.Please note, we calculate your MRD based on a variety of factors such as your date of birth, year-end account balance, and account beneficiaries. If any of this information changes, your Fidelity-provided MRD may no longer be accurate.The MRD estimates use all the information on file as of December 31 of the prior year. For example, transfers that are not processed by December 31 will not be be reflected in the next year's MRD. So, if you transfer funds to your retirement account in late 2015, but they are not received by December 31, 2015, your 2016 MRD will not reflect this deposit. Similarly, beneficiary changes made after December 31 will not be reflected in the current year MRD.If you have consolidated assets, transferred funds, or made a beneficiary change that should have been taken into consideration for the current year, please call our representatives at 800-544-4774 for help recalculating your MRD.Please note, MRD estimates for Fidelity's Profit Sharing Retirement Plan, Money Purchase, and Self‐Employed 401(k) accounts, are presented separately and not aggregated in the All Your Fidelity IRAs section of your portfolio.Additionally, 401(k), 403(b), and 457 plans held at Fidelity and certain annuities are not included in the MRD estimate. To learn more about how we estimate your MRD, please visit the RDC and select Learn more about your MRDs and how they're calculated.Sample RDC calculations page: For illustrative purposes only.",
  "I can not find my MRD estimates on my account statement. Where is it located?": "Your MRD estimates will appear on the account summary page, at the end of the account balance section.",
  "Where can I find the Retirement Distribution Center?": "You can visit the RDC directly at www.fidelity.com/RDCLog In Required. It can also be found on the Track Your Minimum Required Distributions (MRDs) section of your account summary that appears after you log in.For illustrative purposes only.Note: This information is only visible to those with required withdrawals. If you're under 70 ½ or do not own an Inherited IRA account, you may not see the card.If you own an Inherited IRA and are under 70 ½, you may still have required withdrawals. Learn more about MRDs for inherited retirement accountsIf you have required withdrawals but do not see an MRD estimate, we may be missing key information such as your prior year's account balance and date of birth. If that's the case, please update your account.",
  "Can I find my MRD estimates anywhere else?": "Depending on your retirement status, you may see your MRD in account history or on the Withdraw from IRA or Convert to a Roth IRA pages once you're logged in.",
  "How should I handle year-end transfers or rollovers?": "The December 31 market value of each of your retirement accounts should be adjusted for any pending year-end transfers or rollovers. For example, if assets were withdrawn from an IRA or qualified employer-sponsored plan within the last 60 days of the prior calendar year, and then a portion or all of those assets were rolled over to a Fidelity IRA this year, you must add the amount of the rollover to the balance of your Fidelity IRA as of December 31 of the prior year. This may also apply to year-end transfers not credited to your account until after December 31, unless the MRD attributable to the amount transferred was distributed from another IRA.If you are age 70½ or older, generally, you must withdraw the MRD from the employer-sponsored plan prior to rolling it over to your IRA. MRD amounts are not eligible for rollover. Please check your records to determine if that was done properly or ask one of our representatives if you need help understanding any paperwork from that process.",
  "Will Fidelity send me my MRD automatically?": "Yes, if you enroll in our automatic withdrawals process, Fidelity will automatically recalculate your MRD each year, and distribute that amount based on your instructions. Enroll in automatic withdrawals .",
  "How are MRDs taxed?": "MRDs are taxed as ordinary income for the tax year in which they are taken and will be taxed at your applicable individual federal income tax rate. MRDs may also be subject to state and local taxes. If you made non-deductible contributions to your IRA, you must calculate your MRD based on the total balance, but your taxable income may be reduced proportionately for the after-tax contributions. Please consult a tax advisor to learn more.",
  "What if I made non-deductible contributions to my IRA?": "Regardless of whether or not you made non-deductible contributions, you must take the MRD. If you have made non-deductible, after-tax Traditional IRA contributions (or if your account includes any after-tax rollover amounts), you will not have to pay taxes on the portion of your distribution that represents after-tax contributions, provided you have filed IRS Form 8606 each year you made a non-deductible contribution. Remember, you will owe taxes on any earnings on those contributions. Check with your tax advisor on what portion of your account is from non-deductible contributions.",
  "When should I take my first MRD?": "You generally have until April 1 of the year following the calendar year you turn age 70½ to take your first MRD. This is known as your required beginning date (RBD). In subsequent years, the deadline is December 31. If you turned 70 between July 1 of last year and June 30 of this year, you will be turning 70½ this year and will need to take your first MRD for this year.",
  "How should I time my first MRD when it comes to taxes?": "If you take your first MRD between January 1 and April 1 of the year after you turn age 70½, you still need to take your second MRD by December 31 of the same year. Since IRA and Keogh distributions are taxed as ordinary income, this may push you into a higher tax bracket. Also note that if you take your MRD between January 1 and April 1 of the year after you turn age 70½, your December 31 account balance is not reduced by the amount of the MRD taken for the first MRD when calculating the amount of your second MRD. So, be sure to plan your first withdrawal carefully.",
  "How should I take my MRDs if I have multiple non-Roth accounts?": "If you have more than one non-Roth IRA, you must calculate the MRD for each IRA separately each year. However, you may aggregate your MRD amounts for all of your non-Roth IRAs and withdraw the total from one IRA or a portion from each of your IRAs.If you have qualified plan accounts, such as a 401(k) or 403(b), in addition to your IRAs, you must calculate and satisfy your MRDs for IRAs separately from your qualified plan accounts. If you have more than one qualified retirement plan account, you must calculate and satisfy your MRD requirements separately for each qualified plan account.For example, if you have both a profit-sharing plan and a self-employed 401(k), you must separately calculate and withdraw an MRD from each plan. Also, MRDs for Inherited IRAs must be satisfied separately from your other IRAs.After you have fully retired from all employers it may be easier to consolidate your accounts into an IRA in order to make taking MRDs easier to manage. Consider rolling over your retirement accounts to Fidelity and managing your MRDs in one place.Our Retirement Distribution Center can help you keep track of MRDs for your Fidelity IRAs (Traditional IRAs, SEP IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, Rollover IRAs, and all small-business retirement plans). Learn more about our Retirement Distribution Center.",
  "What are the deadlines for taking MRDs?": "You may withdraw your annual MRD in one distribution or make withdrawals periodically throughout the year, but the total annual minimum amount must be withdrawn by the deadline of December 31 (except for your first MRD, as explained above in \"When should I take my first MRD?\").Our Retirement Distribution Center can help you keep track of how much you've withdrawn so you're never behind. You can also set up automatic withdrawals on a monthly, annual, or customized basis. Learn more about our Retirement Distribution Center.",
  "What are the penalties if I miss a deadline?": "The penalty for taking less than your MRD can be severe. If you withdraw less than the minimum required amount, the IRS may assess a penalty equal to 50% of the amount of the MRD not taken. If you missed taking MRDs, consider discussing your options with your tax advisor. You may be able to file for an exemption from the penalty by filing an IRS Form 5329. Consult your tax advisor.",
  "Do I have to take my MRD if I am still working?": "Yes, with certain exceptions:In some circumstances you may delay MRDs from any retirement plan for a current employer, such as a Keogh, 401(k), 403(b), or other employer-sponsored retirement plan account until you retire. If you are still working and have other tax-deferred retirement accounts in previous employers’ plans, you must satisfy your MRD for those other accounts each year beginning when you reach age 70½.Roth IRAs are also an exception, as they are not subject to MRDs while the original account owner is still living.",
  "Can I still contribute to my IRAs while taking MRDs?": "You can contribute to a Roth IRA after age 70½ as long as you have compensation and meet the income eligibility requirements. Otherwise, you generally cannot contribute to any other kind of IRA in the year you turn age 70½ or any year thereafter.",
  "Why is it so important to consider beneficiaries when taking MRDs?": "Retirement accounts generally pass outside the instructions of a will. Your beneficiary designations will determine who receives your retirement assets upon your death. That’s why it is so important to carefully consider who you have designated as a beneficiary on your accounts. Also, there are opportunities for beneficiaries to stretch out the tax-deferred growth of IRA assets after the death of the original account owner. With proper planning, many beneficiaries can minimize their required distributions and potentially maximize the advantage of continued tax deferral.",
  "How do I name a beneficiary?": "A designated beneficiary is an individual, charitable organization, estate, or other entity that you have named to receive any assets in your account upon your death. Update your beneficiaries .You may also complete a beneficiary form.",
  "Should I convert to a Roth IRA, since they do not have MRDs?": "You can convert a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA at any age. If you are over age 70½ when you convert, you will need to take your MRD for the Traditional IRA before converting any other amounts into the Roth IRA. Our online Convert an IRA to a Roth IRA  Calculator will help with that process.",
  "Are Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs) available for IRAs in 2015?": "In 2015, Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs) were permanently extended.For a distribution to qualify as a QCD, it must meet all of the following requirements:Taxpayer must be over the age of 70 ½.Total of all distributions does not exceed the maximum of $100,000 per taxpayer.Distributions are made directly from an IRA to the charity.Written receipt is obtained from each recipient charity.

In section 4, please select the first checkbox, which includes \"check paid to a payee other than the IRA owner.\" Enter the name of the qualified charity, but leave the address blank.
